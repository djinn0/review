    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Lucy is one of the newest penetratable from weredog.
    It is a canine inspired toy with a <q>cartoon-style aesthetic</q>
    I have wanted to try the Lucy ever since its release last spring,
    so when it was discounted during Weredogs annual birthday on February 1, I had to get one.
    Lucy is the second Weredog toy I have reviewed, I previously reviewed the <a href='Sapphire.html' class='content'>Sapphire</a>
    The Lucy has the same excellent detailing and design as the Sapphire with an improved interior, it has quickly become one of my favorite toys.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Weredog is a canine inspired fantasy mastrubator.
    There are 3 color choices signature which is red dark grey with black detailing,
    teak which is a marbled light brown with pink detailing and Hellhound which grey and white with pink detailing.
    My Lucy is the Hellhound style with the light gray and white coloring. 
    It is designed to look like a hellhound with a triangular entrance and fur, abs, and tail detailing.
    The toy is open ended and slightly wider at the hips.
    It is approximately 8 inches long, 4 inches wide with an internal diameter of approximately 0.75 inches.
    Internally the has a narrow opening, the first couple of inches are a bit wider with minimal texture.
    A couple of inches in the texturing becomes more pronounced with encircling rings, and a stimulating mound at the bottom.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>
    The design of the Lucy is exciting and I was quite eager to test it out. 
    The Lucy is somewhat heavy, but the hip detailing provides a good place to grip.
    
    Changing the orientation of Lucy changes the sensations it produces. 
    placing a palm on the end produces a lot of suction, quickly brought me to orgasm the first time.
    tail up lots of sensetion especially on the frenulum. abs up more glans stimulation i can feel the change in texture from the entrance to where the ridges start.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Weredog Lucy is made with pure platinum cured silicone and body safe pigment for color.
    Weredog silicone comes in 3 firmness, all of their penetratables are made with their extra-soft blend. 
    The silicone is soft and squishy but still holds its shape. It has a nice matte surface. 
    Silicone is chemically stable and non-reactive, making it body safe. 
    Because Silicone is non-porous it does not harbor bacteria making it easy to clean and disinfect.
    The Quality of the Weredog Lucy is exceptional. The colors are vibrant. 
    The lines between the different colors are clean with no bleed over. The detailing in the silicone is sharp.
    The trimming marks after the toy was removed from the mold are precise and uniform.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Platnum cured silicone is very durable, it does not tear easily or really wear from normal use.
    The toy does not have any small details that could be easily torn. 
    The corners of the cookie opening are the only weak points I am concerned about, but they are reinforced and I think are unlikely to tear.
    Some silicone lubes can damage silicone toys making the surface sticky so the Lucy should only be used with water or oil based lubes.</br>
    The Lucy is easy to clean after use because it has double openings. I wash it out then allow it to dry before storing it in the included bag. 
    Because it is pure silicone it can be sterilized by boiling, but I have not found it necessary to fully sterilize it.

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Lucy shipped in an discreet cardboard box.
    Inside the box the toy was packaged in a simple heat sealed plastic bag wrapped in a branded cotton storage bag.
    The packaging is similar to other small you brands I have purchased from in the past.
    Although the packaging is simple, I would much rather have a storage bag then a fancy box.
    It did take 20 days for the toy to arrive after ordering.</br>
    I purchased my Lucy during the Annual Weredog birthday sale on February 1st and received a 25% discount.
    The Weredog Lucy is priced by the coloration selected. It costs $118.12 for the teak color or a solid custom color.
    A two color swirl costs $128.86 and the Signature and Hellhound colorations cost $144.96.
    International Shipping cost an additional $30.
    The Weredog Lucy is somewhat expensive, but it is priced in the same range as other fantasy penetratable toys.
    The detailing and quality is excellent I think it is worth the price for anyone who likes the design.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>I think that Weredog did an excellent job on the design of the Lucy. 
    It looks good and the interior texturing feels fantastic. 
    Like many fantasy toys it is more expensive than a comparable sex toy,
    but the whimsical design added to the experience and is worth the cost increase.

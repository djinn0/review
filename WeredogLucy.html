    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Lucy is the newest penetratable from weredog.
    It is a canine inspired toy with a <q>cartoon-style aesthetic</q>
    I have wanted to try the Lucy ever since its release last spring,
    so when it went on sale for Weredogs birthday on February 1, I had to get one.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Weredog is a canine inspired fantasy mastrubator.
    There are 3 color choices signature which is red dark grey with black detailing,
    teak which is a marbled light brown with pink detailing and Hellhound which grey and white with pink detailing.
    My Lucy is the Hellhound style with the light gray and white coloring. 
    It is designed to look like a hellhound with a triangular entrance and fur, abs, and tail detailing.
    The toy is open ended and slightly wider at the hips.
    It is approximately x inches long, y inches wide with an internal diameter of approximately 0.75 inches.
    Internally the has a narrow opening, the first couple of inches are a bit wider with minimal texture.
    A couple of inches in the texturing becomes more pronounced with encircling rings, and a stimulating mound at the bottom.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Weredog Lucy is made with pure platinum cured silicone and body safe pigment for color.
    Weredog silicone comes in 3 firmness, all of their penetratables are made with their extra-soft blend.

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Lucy shipped in an discreet cardboard box.
    Inside the box the toy was packaged in a simple heat sealed plastic bag wrapped in a branded cotton storage bag.
    The packaging is similar to other small you brands I have purchased from in the past.
    Although the packaging is simple, I would much rather have a storage bag then a fancy box.</br>
    I purchased my Lucy during the Annual Weredog birthday sale on February 1st for a 25% off discounted.
    The Weredog Lucy is priced based on the coloration selected. It costs $118.12 for the teak color or a solid custom color.
    A two color swirl costs $128.86 and the Signature and Hellhound colorations cost $144.96.
    The Weredog Lucy is somewhat expensive, but it is priced in the same range as other fantasy penetratable toys.
    The detailing and quality is excellent I think it is worth the price for anyone who likes the design.

    <p class='content'>I was not diagnosed with ADHD until my mid-twenties but I definitely exhibited characteristics and symptoms as a child.
		I had a relatively severe reading delay; I was reading at a kindergarten level when I was tested in 3rd grade.
		I was diagnosed with dyslexia, a learning disability which makes it difficult to recognize how letters relate to words and sounds. My dyslexia potentially masked ADHD symptoms leading it to go undiagnosed.
		Although I couldnâ€™t read I loved stories, and my favorite part of the school day was when our teacher read aloud to us. My teacher read us the first Harry Potter book, then read something else instead of continuing the series, desperate to know what happened I attempted to read the second book on my own. 
		Something finally clicked and I started to love reading. When I was tested again in 4th grade I was reading at a high school junior level after reading voraciously for a year. 
    <p class='content'>
		I was in my mid-twenties when My younger brother was diagnosed with ADHD. Knowing that there is a genetic component to ADHD recognizing tendencies in myself I concluded that I probably also had ADHD.
		I enrolled in a clinical study assessing the effectiveness of a new ADHD medication in order to get a formal diagnosis. 
		Although I had already developed effective coping techniques, a formal diagnosis connected showed me to an extensive body of research, gave me the language to discuss and understand my condition and showed me that there are other people with experiences similar to mine.

    <p class='content'>I was not diagnosed with ADHD until my mid-twenties but I definitely exhibited characteristics and symptoms as a child. I had a relatively severe reading delay; I was reading at a kindergarten level when I was tested in 3rd grade. I was diagnosed with dyslexia, a learning disability which makes it difficult to recognize how letters relate to words and sounds.  My dyslexia potentially masked ADHD symptoms leading it to go undiagnosed. Although I couldn’t read I loved stories, and my favorite part of the school day was when our teacher read aloud to us. My teacher read us the first Harry Potter book but didn’t continue reading the series, desperate to know what happened I attempted to read the second book on my own. Something finally clicked and I started to love reading, when I was tested again in 4th grade I was reading at a high school junior level after voraciously reading for a year. 
My younger brother was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in my mid-twenties after completing an undergraduate degree. Knowing that there is a genetic component to ADHD recognizing tendencies in myself, I enrolled in a clinical study assessing the effectiveness of a new ADHD medication in order to get a formal diagnosis.

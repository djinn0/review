<h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
<p class='content'>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder often diagnosed in childhood but is sometimes diagnosed later in life. 
ADHD usually persists throughout adulthood but symptoms can improve with time, medication, or coping techniques. 
ADHD often presents as inattentively or difficulty paying attention or staying focused, 
hyperactivity characterized as excessive fidgeting or difficulty staying still, and lack of impulse control such as interrupting others or acting out of turn.     </p>

<p class='content'> The Causes of ADHD are not fully understood, there is a genetic component because ADHD often presents in families.
Several genes have been linked with ADHD but their role has not been fully explored. In addition to genetics environmental factors likely play a role.
Risk factors for ADHD include, brain injury, premature delivery, low birth weight, drug use during pregnancy, and exposure to environmental risks at a young age.
Research into the causes of ADHD is ongoing, a recent study (citation) explored a potential connection between the gut microbiome and ADHD.</p>

<p class='content'>I was not diagnosed with ADHD until my mid-twenties but I definitely exhibited characteristics and symptoms as a child.
I had a relatively severe reading delay; I was reading at a kindergarten level when I was tested in 3rd grade. 
I was diagnosed with dyslexia, a learning disability which makes it difficult to recognize how letters relate to words and sounds.
My dyslexia potentially masked ADHD symptoms leading it to go undiagnosed.
Although I couldn’t read I loved stories, and my favorite part of the school day was when our teacher read aloud to us.
My teacher read us the first Harry Potter book but didn’t continue reading the series, desperate to know what happened I attempted to read the second book on my own.
Something finally clicked and I started to love reading, when I was tested again in 4th grade I was reading at a high school junior level after voraciously reading for a year.</p>

<p class='content'>My younger brother was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in my mid-twenties.
Knowing that there is a genetic component to ADHD, and recognizing tendencies in myself I concluded that I probably also had ADHD.
I enrolled in a clinical study assessing the effectiveness of a new ADHD medication in order to get a formal diagnosis.
Although I had already developed effective coping techniques, a formal diagnosis gave me the language to discuss and understand my condition and showed me that there are other people with experiences similar to mine. 
A diagnosis also gave me a reason to explore the expansive body of research that has been done on ADHD, which helped me to better understand and manage my ADHD.</p>

<p class='content'>Because ADHD is such a common condition some research has been done on the impact of ADHD on sexuality and sexual experience.
The <a href='https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adult-adhd-sex-life#symptoms'>effects</a> of ADHD on sexuality can be difficult to measure because symptoms can present differently in each person.
People with ADHD can become distracted during sex reducing their satisfaction or the satisfaction of their partner,
they can also have trouble communicating their needs or responding to the needs of their partners.
Depression or anxiety which are two common symptoms of ADHD can negatively impact sex</p>

<p class='content'>A recent <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9915044/'>study</a> found that people with ADHD engaged in riskier sexual behavior then their peers, and the risk for Females with ADHD was significantly greater than the control group. 
The study also showed that <i></i>“those in the ADHD group were substantially more adventurous in their outlook, interests and sexual practices.”<i></i></p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>Like other Bad Dragon toys the Mystic was packaged in a branded polyethylene bag.
    A plastic bag is a reasonable packaging choice because Bad Dragon toys are sold through the online store,
    so the packaging does not need to be displayable on a store shelf and a plastic bag protects the toy during shipping.
    Bad Dragon toys are priced based on size. My Mystic is the medium which costs $

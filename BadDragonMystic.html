    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Mystic is a fantasy inspired toy and is shaped like a unicorn horn. 
    The Mystic is made by Bad Dragon one of the oldest and most well known fantasy toy manufactures.
    The Mystic has less extreme styling than many fantasy toys but does looks quite elegant. 
    It is a great choice for anyone looking for a  non-representative toy that still looks fun and incorperates fantasy elements.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Bad Dragon Mystic is designed to look like a unicorn horn.
    It has a rounded tip and gradually increases in size. It has a slightly wider base with an integrated suction cup.
    The Mystic has a subtle spiraling groove along the length of the toy. 
    Although the Mystic is a horn, it has a pleasantly rounded profile rather than a sharp, pointy somewhat uncomfortable shape.
    It is more discreet than most dildos but is still obviously a sex toy.
    There are 5 avalible sizes, I have the small which is 8.5 inches long has a max diameter of 1.75 inches and an insertable length of 6.5 inches.
    The Mystic comes in a variety of colors, we chose the Signature color which fades from metalic pink to purple to blue to green with a white marbled base.
    The signature coloring looks very cool and makes the toy feel special especially contrast with the dark matte silicone of most of our collection. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>I purchased the mystic for my wife because she was interested in trying a larger toy, and we both loved the design.
    After inserting the toy and warming up a bit she was able to comfortably take the toy to the hilt.
    She reported that although she could feel the spiral groove it was pretty subtle. 
    When using the mystic on her I found that the mystic would twist because of the spiral groove. 
    She was 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Mystic is made of premium platinum cured silicone.
    Bad Dragon toys are available in 3 different firmnesses, my mystic is the medium firmness, which is pleasantly squishy but maintains its shape.
    The silicone has a smooth shiny finish, that feels a bit sticky when dry, and gets very slick with lube.
    The toy is good quality, the coloring is vibrant and the silicone is smooth without any noticable seams or manufacturing marks.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Pure silicone rubber is a tough material, it resists abrasion and tearing and heat,
    making it a perfect toy material. The Mystic has held up to normal use with no signs of wear, and I expect it will last for years to come.
    There are no small details that can be torn off or damaged. 
    </b>The mystic is very easy to care for, after use I wash it clean and allow it to air dry.
    occasionally I sterilize it by wiping it down with alcohol or running it through the dishwasher. 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>Like other Bad Dragon toys the Mystic was packaged in a branded polyethylene bag.
    A plastic bag is a reasonable packaging choice because Bad Dragon toys generally only are sold through the online store,
    so the packaging does not need to be displayable on a store shelf. A plastic bag also protects the toy during shipping.
    Bad Dragon toys are priced based on size. My Mystic is the small which costs $90 plus $20 for the signature coloring. 
    Bad dragon toys are expensive, and may not be worth the cost for some buyers.
    We like the Mystic and expect to keep it and use it for years, so for us buying it was an investment in pleasure and whimsy.

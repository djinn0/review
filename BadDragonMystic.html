    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Mystic is a fantasy inspired toy and is shaped like a unicorn horn. 
    The Mystic is made by Bad Dragon one of the oldest and best known fantasy toy manufactures. </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Bad Dragon Mystic is designed to look like a unicorn horn.
    It has a rounded tip and gradually increases in size. It has a slightly wider base with an integrated suction cup.
    The Mystic has a subtle spiraling groove along the length of the toy. 
    Although the Mystic is a horn, it has a pleasantly rounded profile rather than a sharp somewhat uncomfortable shape.
    There are 5 avalible sizes, I have the medium which is look up size
    The Mystic comes in a variety of colors, we chose the Signature color which fades from metalic pink to purple to blue to green with a white marbled base.
    The signature coloring looks very cool and makes the toy feel special especially contrast with the dark matte silicone of most of our collection. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>I purchased the mystic for my wife because she was interested in trying a bigger toy, and we both loved the design.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Mystic is made of premium platinum cured silicone.
    Bad Dragon toys are available in 3 different firmnesses, my mystic is the medium firmness, which is pleasantly squishy but maintains its shape.
    The toy is good quality, the coloring is vibrant and the silicone is smooth without any noticable seams or manufacturing marks.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Pure silicone rubber is a tough material, it resists abrasion and tearing and heat,
    making it a perfect toy material. The Mystic has held up to normal use with no signs of wear, and I expect it will last for years to come.
    There are no small details that can be torn of or damaged. 
    </b>The mystic is very easy to care for, after use I wash it clean and allow it to air dry.
    occasionally I sterilize it by wiping it down with alcohol or running it through the dishwasher. 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>Like other Bad Dragon toys the Mystic was packaged in a branded polyethylene bag.
    A plastic bag is a reasonable packaging choice because Bad Dragon toys are sold through the online store,
    so the packaging does not need to be displayable on a store shelf and a plastic bag protects the toy during shipping.
    Bad Dragon toys are priced based on size. My Mystic is the medium which costs $120 plus $20 for the signature coloring.

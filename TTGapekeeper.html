    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Gape Keeper is an excellent butt plug produced by the Canada based company Topped Toys.
    Topped toys is a newer company founded by 3 acquaintances who were frustrated with the difficulty of acquiring quality anal toys in Canada.
    Their passion for toy design combined with their experience in Marketing, managing startups and chemical engineering helped them launch a successful company that has released an expansive line of anal toys.
    As a somewhat novice but enthusiastic butt plug enjoyer I have wanted to try a Topped Toy plug since I discovered the company a few months ago. 
    I purchased a gape keeper, a comfortable daily wear plug, for my first review.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Gape Keeper is a butt plug designed to be comfortable for extended wear, 
    while providing a satisfying stretch. 
    The Gape Keeper has an elongated oval shape that tapers into a relatively wide neck. 
    The plug has a ergonomic base that is comfortable but still feels secure.
    The Gape keeper comes in 12 sizes, from the beginner friendly 45 which is 1.5 inches in diameter to the absolutely massive 150 which is 5.1 inchs in diameter. 
    I purchased the Gape Keeper 55 which is one of their smallest offerings but still as thick as my current largest plug.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>content</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Gape Keeper is made of platinum cured silicone. 
    Silicone can be cured by using platinum metal as a catalyst,
    which causes the silicone molecules to bond together without producing any toxic byproducts.
    Platinum curing is the preferred method for medical applications and for high quality sex toys.
    Topped Toys uses a super soft silicone blend. 
    
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Silicone is quite durable</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The packaging of the Gape Keeper was very minimal; 
    It was shrinked wrapped in clear plastic with stickers showing that the toy is 100% silicone and made in Canada.
    The Gape Keeper was shipped in a discrete cardboard box. <br>
    The Gape Keeper 55 costs $36 for the blue steel and obsidian colors and $48 for the forge red color.
    I think that the gape keeper is reasonably priced for such a well designed and quality toy.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>Topped toys is one of the coolest and most inovative companies in the adult toy space. 
    I am glad that Topped Toys makes the Gape Keeper in so many sizes; I am planning to size up soon</p>

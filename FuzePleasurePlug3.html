    <h1 class='title'>Fuze Pleasure Plug Review</h1>
  
    <div class='content'><img src='image1.jpg' alt='placeholder image' class='picture'></div>


    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pleasure plug 3 is a lovely classically styled buttplug made by Fuze toys, a small Canadian sextoy manufacturer.
     The Pleasure plug is manufactured in the United States using medical grade silicone. 
     Fuze included some modern updates that make the Pleasure Plug very functional and comfortable to wear.
     The Pleasure Plug is available in 4 sizes, this review is for size 3 because I like it best.
     At the time of this writing there were no in-depth Reviews of the Fuze Pleasure Plugs, so I decided it was my solumn duty as a sex toy enthusiasist to write one.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pleasure Plug 3 is medium sized with a classic design tapered design. 
     The plug is 5 inches long, has an insertable length of 4.75 inches and a diameter of 1.4 inches.
     The plugs gentle taper from the tip makes the plug easy to insert despite its size. 
     The plug also has a nice inverse taper from the bulb to the neck, 
     which makes the plug pleasant to pull out, but still holds it in securely in place. 
     The neck is wide enough to provide a gentle stretching sensation,
     but pliable enough that it is comfortable for extended wear. 
     The T-shaped base is the most modern feature of the plug,
     and is a pleasing departure from the classic buttplug design.
     The base is sturdy enough that the plug can not be pulled in,
     but nestles comfortably and discreetly between the butt cheeks

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'><em>First Impressions:</em> When I purchased the the Fuze Pleasure Plug 3, it was the longest buttplug I had ever tried and it was a
    a little intimidating (I have tried a variety of plugs but I am still a novice when it comes to size). 
    I warmed up with the <a href=TantusJuice.html>Tantus Juice</a> a shorter plug with the same diameter as the pleasure plug 3. 
    I relaxed and took my time inserting the plug, which slid in quite easily after a bit of warm-up. The sensations were pretty intense initially, but my muscles relaxed after a few minutes and the plug started to feel more manageable.
    After my muscles had relaxed I got in the shower and had a relaxed mastrubation session enjoying the full sensation of the Pleasure Plug</p>
    <p class='content'><em>Long Term Observations:</em> The Tapered tip makes the Fuze Pleasure Plug easy to insert but it can feel a bit pokey internally after the plug is first inserted.
    It stays in place and enhances solo play and partnered sex. It is comfortable enough for extended wear but its not my first choice.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pleasure Plug is made from Fuzes premium silicone blend.
    It has a shiny and smooth surface, which gets very slick when lubed but also attracts lint.
    The silicone is pliable and comfortable but firm enough to be easy to insert. 
    The Pleasure plug has a simple but well executed design and feels well made.
    The plug is a beautiful purple color. Although there is a seam from the molding process it can barely be seen and it cannot be felt.
    The silicon does not retain scent after being cleaned.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <p class='content'>Premium platinum cured silicone is quite durable. 
    The Pleasure plug 3 feels like it will last for ever if care for. The plug does not have any crevices so it is easy to clean.
    After use I wash it with soap and hot water, then allow it to dry. I wipe the plug with 70% ethanol to sterilize the surface. 
    The shiny silicone attracts lint so I store it in a microfiber sunglasses pouch.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Fuze Pleasure Plug 3 came in a clear plastic box, with minimal ornamentation. 
    The clear box displays the plugs size and design and highlights its lovely color.
    The box is durable enough to store the plug in or can be desposed of discreetly.
    The Pleasure plug costs $42.50 which is on the expensive side for a simple silicone plug.

    <h2 class='content'>Comparison of Fuze Pleasure Plugs</h2>
    <p class='content'>Fuze makes Pleasure Plugs in 4 sizes.
      The size 1 plug is 4.125 inches in length and 0.875 inches in diameter, approximately finger sized. 
      The size 2 plug is 4.38 inches in length and 1.25 inches in diameter.
      The size 3 plug, which this review is primarily about, 4.75 inches in length and 1.4 inches in diameter.
      The size 4 plug is a respectable 5.5 inches in length and 1.625 inches in diameter. 
      The plugs are priced $26.50, $29.50 $42.50 and $54.50 respectively. 
      There is a reasonable size progression between the plugs and they would make a good training set, if it wasn't so expensive to aquire all 4.
      Plugs 2 and 3 are the best sizes for most users, size 1 is a great beginner plug and size 4 is satisfyingly filling for a more experienced user.
      The different sized plugs are similarly shaped but have slightly different angles and dimensions that best match the plugs diameters</p>

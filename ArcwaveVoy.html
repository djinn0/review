    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The is a small masturbator made by the male focused brand Arcwave. 
    Arcwave is a part of the the German based pleasure products conglomerate WOW Tech Group which also owns WeVibe, Womanizer and Pjur.
    The <a href='ArcwavePow.html'>Arcwave Pow</a> is one of my favorite toys, so I was excited to try the Voy which has a similar design and uses identical materials.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Voy is a short open-ended masturbator.
    It has a hard plastic case, a soft silicone sleeve and two endcaps that are removed during use.
    A unique feature of the Voy is that the interior sleeve can be tightened or loosened by twisting an adjustment ring.
    the sleeve has a simple ripple texture. The sleeve can be removed from the shell for cleaning. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>content</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The exterior shell of the Arcwave is made of ABS plastic which is light and very durable.
    The sleeve is made of a super soft silicone blend. The silicone is smooth, shiney, a bit sticky to the touch, and gets very slick when lubed.
    A silicone is an upgrade compared to similar toys, because it is longer lasting than TPE and is better at resisting bacterial contamination.

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>ABS plastic is very tough so I dont expect the case or endcaps will break, even with moderate abuse
    like throwing it in the bottom of a checked duffle bag before a flight. Soft Silicone is somewhat more delicate than harder silicone blends,
    but is significantly more durable than TPE which many sleeves are made of. 
    The sleeve does not have any small texture elements and us circular so it is unlikely to tear. 
    It has held up to vigorous testing in the couple of months I have had it without any signs of wear.
  </p> </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Voy is packaged in a white box, with a picture of the toy, black text and light blue accents.
    The packaging is reminiciant of a computer or video game accessory.
    The Arcwave Voy has a msrp of $85, and is often avalible on sale.
    The Voy is pricier than similar toys made by other companies, but it is made of better materials, and has more features. 
    I payed $50 for my Voy which is a steal, but I would be comfortable playing full price with how much I have enjoyed it.
    <!-- if it is too small change this -->

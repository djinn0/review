    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The is a small open ended masturbator made by the male focused brand Arcwave. 
    Arcwave is a part of the the German based pleasure products conglomerate WOW Tech Group which also owns WeVibe, Womanizer and Pjur. 
    The Voy has a textured soft silicon sleave inside a hard plastic case.
    The <a href='ArcwavePow.html'>Arcwave Pow</a> is a toy I have thoroughly enjoyed, so I was excited to try the Voy which has a similar design and uses identical materials.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Voy is a short open-ended masturbator.
    It has a hard plastic case, a soft silicone sleeve and two endcaps that are removed during use. 
    The Voy has an insertable length of 4 inches and an internal diameter of approximately 1.75 inches.
    A unique feature of the Voy is that the interior sleeve can be tightened or loosened by twisting an adjustment ring.
    The sleeve has a simple ripple texture, designed to be stimulating with different tightnesses. 
    The sleeve can be removed from the shell for cleaning, but it is usually not necessary to remove the sleeve.
    The Voy has a subtle design, it looks a bit like a camera lens, and is not immediately recognizable as a sex toy with the end caps on.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>I have used the Arcwave a few times, these are observations. 
    The tightness adjustment worked better than I expected and is a feature that I ended up really enjoying.
    The ripples texture was pretty subtle initially, but increase in intensity as I tightened the toy.
    Using the Voy was noiser than I expected because it is open ended with no suction. The sleeve rubbing against the case makes a percussive ratatat sound.
    The Silicone feels a bit sticky and there is a bit of drag unless a generous portion of lube is used.
    I set the edging by adjusting tightness. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The exterior shell of the Arcwave is made of ABS plastic which is light and very durable.
    The sleeve is made of a super soft silicone blend. The silicone is smooth, shiney, a bit sticky to the touch, and gets very slick when lubed.
    A silicone sleeve is an upgrade compared to similar toys, because it is longer lasting than TPE and is better at resisting bacterial contamination.
    The Voy, like most Arcwave products appears well made and stylish.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>ABS plastic is very tough so I dont expect the case or endcaps will break, even with moderate abuse
    like throwing it in the bottom of a checked duffle bag before a flight. Soft Silicone is somewhat more delicate than harder silicone blends,
    but is significantly more durable than TPE which many sleeves are made of. 
    The sleeve does not have any small texture elements and is circular so it is unlikely to tear. 
    It has held up to vigorous testing in the couple of months I have had it without any signs of wear.
    The open ended design makes the Voy very easy to clean, usually I run warm water through the center to wash out the lube then let it dry.
    After using the Voy in the shower I remove the sleeve from the case to better dry everything. 
    The silicone is very sticky and attracts lint so I put on the endcaps and put the toy away as soon as everything is dry.

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Voy is packaged in a white box, with a picture of the toy, black text and light blue accents.
    The packaging is reminiciant of a computer or video game accessory.
    The Arcwave Voy has a msrp of $85, and is often avalible on sale.
    The Voy is pricier than similar toys made by other companies, but it is made of, in my opinion, better materials, and has more features. 
    I paid $45 for my Voy, but I would be probably pay full price with how much I have enjoyed it.
    <!-- if it is too small change this -->

    <h2 class='content'>Comparasons to other toys</h2>
    <p class='content'>I have now tested both the Acwave Pow and Voy.
    The best part of both toys is their silicone sleeves.
    I like the Spiral sleeve texture of the Arcwave Pow better than the ripple rings of the Voy.
    The tightness adjustment of the Voy works well, unlike the worthless suction function of the Pow.
    Both toys are equally easy to clean. I like the longer length of the Pow better than the Voy. 
    Between the two toys I like the Voy better because of the tightness adjustment, but I only like it slightly more than the Pow.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>Overall I like the Arcwave Voy.
    I enjoyed the ability to adjust the tightness during use more than I expected.</p>
    I like the discreet design, and materials choices. 
    There are many similar toys in the same price range so I do not think it is an essential purchase,
    but it is well designed and fufills its function.

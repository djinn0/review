    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bvibe snug plugs are frequently found in lists of best buttplugs for good reason.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bvibe snug plug is a cylinder shaped plug with a slight taper on the top and bottom of the bulb. 
    The Snug Plug is 1.2 inches in diameter and 4.1 inches in length.
    It has a long thin neck and a t-shaped base. The thin neck makes the plug ideal for extended wear.
    The torpedo shaped bulb holds two steel balls that roll around as the wearer moves,
    The balls add sensation and weight and make the plug hard to ignore or forget. 
    The plug is made of smooth silicone that comes a few different colors.
    Bvibe makes the snug plug in multiple sizes up to 2.5 inches in diameter.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bvibe snug plug 2 is the buttplug that I use most. 
    I like to slip it in a couple of hours before I plan on having sex or masturbating,
    and just enjoy the sensations as I go about my day.
    The first time I used the plug I expected it to be difficult to insert because it only has a slight taper,
    I took my time warming up and used lots of lube, the plug slid right in with minimal effort.
    After using the plug a few times I tried putting it in without any warm-up,
    it was doable but the stretching sensation was more intense.
    After using it a few times it has become easy to insert and I often use it to warm-up for other toys.
    After using the plug for a few months I decided to go for a run with it in. 
    The run started out amazing the steel balls vibrating with every step, after a couple of miles the plug's base started to chafe my buttcheeks
    which was rather uncomfortable. When I finished the run I immediately pulled the plug out, without even playing with my self like I had planned.
    The plug is great during sex and for walking around the house, but it is a poor tool for motivating me to exercise.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Snug Plug is made with a hybrid of materials providing the comfort on silicone and the weight of metal. 
    The plug has a hard abs plastic shell that contains 2 steel balls, the plastic shell is encased in soft silicone.
    The steel balls move around inside providing pleasant vibrations and making the plug feel weightier than expected based on its size.
    The matte silicone feels smooth and velvety to the touch and gets quite slick when lubricated. 
    The neck is too flexible to be used to insert the plug but is quite comfortable after insertion, making the snug plug ideal for extended wear.
    The t-base is comfortable and firm enough to hold the plug safely in place. 
    The silicone does retain a smell even after washing and disinfection, which is unfortunate.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bvibe Snug Plug has the best packaging of any plug I have purchased.
    It came in a stylish black box with a clear plastic front to display the plug.
    In addition to the plug, cute stickers, a storage bag and small booklet entitled
    <i>Guide to anal play</i> were included in the box. The Snug Plug costs $54.99 on Bvibes website
    and is also easy to find elsewhere.

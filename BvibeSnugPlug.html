    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bvibe snug plug 2 is the buttplug that I use most. 
    I like to slip it in a couple of hours before I plan on having sex or masturbating,
    and just enjoy the sensations as I go about my day.
    My first time I used the plug I expected it to be difficult to insert because of its blunted taper</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Snug Plug is made with a hybrid of materials providing the confort on silicone and the weight of metal. 
    The plug has a hard abs plastic shell that contains 2 steel balls, the plastic shell is encased in soft silicone.
    The steel balls move around inside providing pleasant vibrations and making the plug feel weightier than expected based on its size.
    The matte silicone feels smooth and velvety to the touch and gets quite slick when lubricated. 
    The neck is too flexible to be used to insert the plug but is quite comfortable after insertion, making the snug plug ideal for extended wear.
    The t-base is comfortable and firm enough to hold the safely plug in place. The silicone does retain a smell even after washing and disinfection.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bvibe Snug Plug has the best packaging of any plug I have purchased.
    It came in a stylish black box with a clear plastic front to display the plug.
    In addition to the plug, cute stickers, a storage bag and small booklet entitled
    <i>Guide to anal play</i> were included in the box. The Snug Plug costs $54.99 on Bvibes website
    and is also easy to find elsewhere.

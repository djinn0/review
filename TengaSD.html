    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tenga SD is a new addition to Tenga's excellent line of disposable Masturbators. The SD is a stroker/Onacup style toy,
    designed to provide strong suction and lots of sensation in a smaller form factor.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tenga SD is a shorter version of the original Tenga Vacuum Cup.
    It is a disposable cup style toy with soft textured sleeve inside a firm plastic shell.
    The SD has a internal length of 4.3 inches and is specificly designed to to stimulate the penis tip.
    The cup's short length allows the average user to reach the cushion end providing strong and direct stimulation to the glans.
    The hourglass shape of the cup makes it easy to hold, and provides a pleasant feeling of tightness and constriction.
    The toy is designed to produce a strong sucking sensation on the up stroke; 
    There is a hole on the top of the cup that prevents air from entering when covered with a finger creating suction.
    The Tenga SD is designed solely around providing specific sensations without any consideration for durability or ease of cleaning. I find the simple focused design refreshing.</p>
    <p class='content'>I like the Tenga SD and wish there was a reusable version, but making one would be a bit of a design challenge.
    Reusable strokers and sleeves need to be easy to clean. To accomplish this most toys are either designed to open at both ends
    like the <a target="_parent" href="ArcwavePow.html">Arcwave Pow</a> so water can be flushed through, or open up like the <a target="_parent" href="TengaFlipOrb.html">Tenga Flip Orb</a>
    so that the interior can be washed. The tight hourglass shape and the textured tip, which are the SD's best design features, would make it difficult to clean as a reusable toy.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>I opened up the Tenga SD to find that it came pre-lubed, 
    I was already hard in anticipation of pleasure so I slid right in. 
    I could feel the textured nubs near the entrance which pleasurably stimulated my glans and frenulum.
    The narrow section provided a pleasant feeling of tightness, the end of the sleeve was very squishy and soft. 
    After a minute of exploring the internal textures I covered the pressure hole to try the vacuum function. 
    The suction was strong and provided a tugging sensation on the upstroke. 
    I decided to take my time with the toy and thoroughly enjoy my single use. 
    I edged for a few minutes alternating between slow strokes and pauses to cool down. Finally I increased my rhythm and finished.
    I placed the cap back on the cup and disposed of it satisfied with my experience.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tenga SD's soft sleeve is made of Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE)
    and the outer casing is made of polyethylene  plastic (PE).
    Neither material is ideal for a reusable toy,
    for durability and sterility reasons, but are well suited for disposable toy.
    The TPE is well textured and the PE plastic is light weight making the cup easy to hold.
    The SD is better designed and feels more luxurious than most disposable toys, including some of Tenga's other offerings</p>

    <div id='m'></div>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tenga is wrapped in colorful red and white shrink wrap printed with instructions for use.
    The wrapping makes the toy look fun and bright, after being unwrapped the toy is plane white and looks somewhat bland.
    The Tenga SD costs $8.00 on Tenga's website and is also available from various retailers.
    $8.00 is a reasonable price to try something new, but buying the SD repeatedly would quickly get expensive.</p>

    <p class='content'>The Tenga SD feels great, I wish there was a reusable version.

    or a treat for more experienced users. I would love a reusable version.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tenga SD is a shorter version of the original Tenga Vacuum Cup.
    It is a disposable cup style toy with soft textured sleeve inside a firm plastic shell.
    The SD has a internal length of 4.3 inches and is specificly designed to to stimulate the penis tip.
    The cup's short length allows the average user to reach the cushion end providing strong and direct stimulation.
    The hourglass shape of the cup makes it easy to hold, and provides a pleasant feeling of tightness and constriction.

    <p class='content'>I like the Tenga SD and wish there was a reusable version, but making one would be a bit of a design challenge.
    Reusable strokers and sleeves need to be easy to clean. To accomplish this most toys are either designed to open at both ends
    like the <a target="_parent" href="ArcwavePow.html">Arcwave Pow</a>so water can be flushed through or open up like the <a target="_parent" href="TengaFlipOrb.html">Tenga Flip Orb</a></p>
    The tight hourglass shape and the textured end which are the SD's best design features also make it difficult to clean.
    
    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tenga SD's soft sleeve is made of Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE)
    and the outer casing is made of polyethylene  plastic (PE).
    Neither material is ideal for a reusable toy,
    for durability and sterility reasons, but are well suited for disposable toy.
    The TPE is well textured and the PE is light weight making the cup easy to hold.
    The Tenda SD costs $8.00 on Tenga's website and is also available from various retailers.
    $8.00 is a reasonable price to try something new, but buying the SD repeatedly would quickly get expensive.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tenga is wrapped in colorful red and white shrink wrap printed with instructions for use.
    The wrapping makes the toy look fun and bright, after being unwrapped the toy is plane white and lookes somewhat bland.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <p class='content'>I frequently think about death and consider funny or elaborate things that could be done with my body after I am gone. I am in no hurry to die, but thinking about death encourages me to use and cherish the time I do have.
    I have considered having my body tossed into a peat bog or glacier crevasse to be discovered by explorer in 1000 years.
    I think it would be funny to have a viewing and be placed in my coffin stark naked; everyone would be standing around trying to act solumn and serious while staring at my naked wrinkly corpse.
    My current plan is to be used as the carbon source in a large terrarium planted with a sapling tree. Over the years the tree will grow eventually shattering the terrarium glass and release my molecules into the atmosphere.
    is to but being buried in a sarcophagus full of my favorite sex toys like a Pharaoh of old is definitely an 
    attractive</p>

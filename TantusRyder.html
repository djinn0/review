    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>I started my blog a year ago with a review of the <a href='TantusJuice.html'>Tantus Juice Plug</a>,
    today I am celebrating one year by reviewing the Ryder another offering from Tantus. 
    The Ryder is an intermediate butt plug with similar dimensions to the Juice but has a more rounded shape.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Ryder has a rounded tip an slight taper.
    The Ryder has a max diameter of 1.47" and a length of 4”.
    It has a T-shaped base designed to sit comfortably between the butt cheeks.
    Engraved on one side of the base is the Tantus logo.
    The neck of the plug is approximately 1" in length and .75” in width making it fairly comfortable.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>Despite only having a minimal taper the Tantus Ryder is realitivly easy to insert.
    Once inserted it stays firmly in place, i have never felt like it could slip out even during vigorous physical activity. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Ryder is made of Tantus' excellent silicone.
    It currently comes in two colors, oynx and Lilic ehich ste black and a light purple respectively.
    It has a matte finish which feels velvety to the touch and does not attract lint.
    The silicone is realitivly firm eith a little give which is perfect for a toy of its size.
    Overall the quality of the Ryder is good, the silicone is smooth and uniform and it functions as designed.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Like most silicone toys the Tantus Ryder is quite durable and will last for years if cared for.
    The matte silicone is easy to clean, after use I scrub the plug with soap and warm water then allow it to dry. 
    Once it has dried I sanitize it with alcohol before putting away in my toy box. 
    Because the Ryder is made of pure silicone it can be sterilized by boiling for 3-5 min. </p>

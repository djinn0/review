    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Vice has a IPX7 water resistance rating, meaning it can be submerged for 30 min at a depth of up to 1 meter without suffering damage.
    The Vice 2 can be cleaned with hot water and soap. The silicone surface can be sanitized with alcohol.
    The remote is not water resistant and should not be washed, it can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth.
    I store the Vice 2 in a microfiber pouch between uses which keeps it free from lint and allows scents to dissipate.

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Aneros Vice 2 was packaged in a fashionable black and red box. 
    The box has has a picture of the Vice, a badge showing that Aneros was chosen as the <i>Sexual Health and Wellness Brand of the Year</i> and text stating that the Vice is a <i>vibrating male g-spot stimulator</i>.
    Inside the outer packaging is a second black box with magnetic clasps that opens displaying the plug and remote in a plastic tray. 
    Overall I like the packaging which feels bold and stylish, but I am mystified that Aneros describes the Vice 2 as a <i>vibrating male g-spot stimulator</i> on the box.
    The g-spot is a erogenous zone on the anterior vaginal wall, the prostate which the Vice 2 is designed to stimulate is often compared to the g-spot, but they are entirely different anatomical structures.
    The Vice 2 costs $149.95. Although I do like the Vice, I think it is two expensive for the average anal toy enthusiast.

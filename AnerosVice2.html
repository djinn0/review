    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Aneros Vice 2 is an excellent prostate vibrator designed to provide stimulation through vibration and through manual pressure.
    Like most Aneros toys the Vice is shaped to manually massage the prostate by clenching and releasing the pelvic floor muscles. 
    The Vice 2 has a rechargeable battery and is controlled with a remote, making it easy to use. 
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Aneros Vice 2 is a prime example of Sex toy design where form follows function. 
    The Vice 2 eschews the traditional buttplug design of a tapered tip, wide bulb, narrow neck and broad base in favor of a design that better fits the male anatomy. 
    The Vice has two Asymmetrical bulbs that cup the prostate, a narrower neck to hold the plug in place and a thin almost hook shaped base. 
    Aneros toys are designed to pivot when the pelvic floor muscles are contracted pressing more firmly into the prostate.
    The Vice has 2 vibrating motors to provide additional sensation, a motor near the top stimulates the prostate and a motor near the base stimulates the perineum and butthole.
    The Vice isnt a particularly large prostate toy with a maximum width of 1.3 inches but it is a long toy with an insertable length of 4.5 inches.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>I wanted to get an initial impression of the Aneros Vice 2, so after unpackaging I it checked the charge, applied lube and inserted it.
    My muscles took a few minutes to relax around the vice which distracted from the vibrations. I have use similarly sized toys semi frequently so I didn't anticipate needing much warmup.
    I enjoyed the different vibration patterns but I didn't feel that they were strong enough. 
    I later learned that that the vibration intensity can be adjusted by tapping the power button on the remote.
    I enjoyed clenching my muscles to press the vice into my prostate most on my first experience, and found the design of the plug quite effective.
    </p>
    <p class='content'>
    Having Learned from my first experience with the Vice, I warmed up and allowed my muscles to relax with the <a href='TantusJuice.html'>Tantus Juice plug</a> which is similarly sized.
    The Vice was significantly more comfortable and less intense after warming up. I turned on the vibrations enjoying the sensations for a few minutes. 
    I turned up the vibration intensity and started clenching my pelvic floor muscles in time with the vibrations making use of the Vice's unique design.

    I found the controls to be somewhat unintuitive and did not figure out how to adjust the vibration intensity until I read the manual. 
    
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Vice 2 feels like a high-end toy, it is heavier than it looks probably due to the weight of the battery and motors. 
    The matte silicone is exceptionally smooth it feels velvety to the touch when dry, and is reasonably slick when lubed.
    The Vice has two motors, the motor towards the tip is nice and rumbly and the motor towards the base is more buzzy.  </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Aneros Vice 2 feels quite durable, the whole toy is coated in a firm silicon. The Vice 2 is quite rigid so I suspect it has a tough ABS plastic core like other Aneros toys. 
    The neck is sturdy protecting the connection between the control button at the plug's base and the motors in the body, this connection is a known weakpoint in various other vibrating plugs.
    Some users have reported trouble with the remote but I have had no issues with mine. If something does go wrong Aneros offers a 2 year warranty on vibrating toys.
    The Vice has a IPX7 water resistance rating, meaning it can be submerged for 30 min at a depth of up to 1 meter without suffering damage.
    The Vice 2 can be cleaned with hot water and soap. The silicone surface can be sanitized with alcohol.
    The remote is not water resistant and should not be washed, it can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
    Aneros recommends removing the charger from the toy as soon as it charged to preserve battery life.
    Between uses I store the Vice 2 in a microfiber pouch, which keeps it free from lint and allows scents to dissipate.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Aneros Vice 2 was packaged in a fashionable black and red box. 
    The box has has a picture of the Vice, a badge showing that Aneros was chosen as the <i>Sexual Health and Wellness Brand of the Year</i> and text stating that the Vice is a <i>vibrating male g-spot stimulator</i>.
    Inside the outer packaging is a second black box with magnetic clasps that opens displaying the plug and remote in a plastic tray. 
    Overall I like the packaging which feels bold and stylish,
    but I am mystified that Aneros describes the Vice 2 as <i>a Male g-spot stimulator</i> considering that the g-spot is an anatomical structure most males do not possess.
    <!--that Aneros describes the Vice 2 as a <i>vibrating male g-spot stimulator</i> on the box. The g-spot is a erogenous zone on the anterior vaginal wall, the prostate which the Vice 2 is designed to stimulate is often compared to the g-spot, but they are entirely different anatomical structures.-->
    The Vice 2 costs $149.95. Although I do like the Vice, I think it is too expensive for the average anal toy enthusiast.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <p class='content'>Overall I think the Aneros Vice 2 is a great toy. It has a unique design,
    that allows it to effectively stimulate the prostate both manually and with vibrations.
    The remote makes it easy to control and is probably my favorite feature.
    It is ergonomic and comfortable. The biggest downside is its expensive price.

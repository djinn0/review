    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pleasure plug 3 in an excellence buttplug made by Fuze toys, a small Canadian sextoy company.
     There are almost no reviews for fuze pleasure plugs which is a shame because it is one my favorite plugs, so I decided to write one.
     Fuze makes the Pleasure Plug in 4, sizes this review is for suze 3 because I like it best.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pleasure Plug 3 is medium sized with a classic design tapered design. 
     The plug is 5 inches long, has an insertable length of 4.75 inches and a diameter of 1.4 inches.
     The plugs gentle taper from the tip makes the plug easy to insert despite its size. 
     The plug also has a nice inverse taper from the bulb to the neck, 
     which makes the plug pleasant to pull out, but still holds it in securely in place. 
     The neck is wide enough to provide a gentle stretching sensation,
     but pliable enough that it is comfortable for extended wear. 
     The T-shaped base is the most modern feature of the plug,
     and is a pleasing departure from the classic buttplug design.
     The base is sturdy enough that the plug can not be pulled in,
     but nestles comfortably and discreetly between the butt cheeks

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Fuze Pleasure Plug 3 came in a clear plastic box, with minimal ornamentation. 
    The clear box displays the plugs size and design and highlights its lovely color.
    The box is durable enough to store the plug in or can be desposed of discreetly.
    The Pleasure plug costs $42.50 which is on the expensive side for a simple silicone plug.

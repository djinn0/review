    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Flip Orb follows the design aesthetic of most Tenga toys; sleek function driven design usually lacking anatomical features. 
    It is a stroker or onahole style toy with a hard outer shell encasing a soft textured inner sleeve. The casing is hinged and opens making the toy easy to clean.
    The opening design also makes it easy to apply lube evenly to the toys interior. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The hard exterier shell is made of polycarbonate which is durable and relatively lightweight.
    The inner sleve is made of Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) which feels good but can harbor bacteria if improperly cleaned. 
    The orbs are made out of ABS plastic and completely encased in the TPE sleeve.  </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Flip orb was packaged in a simple clear plastic clamshell.
    The packaging has minimal decoration designed to highlight the toy and its features. 
    The packaging serves its purpose of protecting the toy and can be disposed of discreetly. 
    There were 2 sachets of Tenga lube. The flip orb costs $69 (nice!), which is a reasonable price 
    for a reusable toy from one of the top toy manufactures.</p>

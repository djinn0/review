    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>content</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Flip Orb follows the design aesthetic of most Tenga toys; sleek function driven design usually lacking anatomical features. 
    It is a stroker or onahole style toy with a hard outer shell encasing a soft textured inner sleeve. There are hard plastic orbs encased in the sleeve which provide stimulation to the penis shaft.  
    The casing is hinged and opens making the toy easy to clean.
    The hinged design also makes it easy to apply lube evenly to the toys interior. The toys oriface has a series of concentric ribs which trap lube inside.
    The flip orb is hourglass shaped whick makes it easy to grip and adds a constriction point to the interior sleeve.
    There are flexible panels which increase sensation and create suction when squeezed.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>The opening is tight but very stretchy and soft making insertion feels great.
    The sleeve has a nice interior texture which provides pleasant but not overwhelming sensation.
    The orbs are subtle and provide less sensation than I anticipated. 
    Most Tenga toys are designed to provide suction, but the Flip Orb produced significantly more suction than I expected.
    The suction feels great but there is no release valve so I had to open the toy or pull out to reduce the pressure. 
    The Flip orb is easy to clean after use, I open it up rinse it with cool water and leave it open to dry.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The hard exterier shell is made of polycarbonate which is durable and relatively lightweight.
    The inner sleve is made of Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) which feels good but can harbor bacteria if improperly cleaned. 
    The orbs are made out of ABS plastic and completely encased in the TPE sleeve.
    I have had the Tenga Flip Orb for a couple of years and it is starting to show signs of wear. 
    Some of the nubs of the TPE sleeve have gotten worn or stretched out.
    I was initially concerned that the hinge would break, because it appears somewhat delicate, but it has withstood vigorous use for over a year.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Flip orb was packaged in a simple clear plastic clamshell.
    The packaging has minimal decoration designed to highlight the toy and its features. 
    The packaging serves its purpose of protecting the toy and can be disposed of discreetly. 
    There were 2 sachets of Tenga lube. The flip orb costs $69 (nice!), which is a reasonable price 
    for a reusable toy from a renowned sex toy manufacturer.</p>

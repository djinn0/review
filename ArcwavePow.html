    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Pow is canister style stroker,
    composed of a soft textured silicone sleeve encased in a hard plastic cylinder.
    The Pow is 7 inches in length and 2.75 inches in diameter, 
    with a usable inner length of 6.5 inches. 
    The Pow has openings at both ends covered by removable caps,
    one opening is wider than the other providing different sensations.
    The sleeve has a uniform texture throughout of spiraling ridges, which are simple but very effective. 
    The inner sleeve can be removed from the cylinder for cleaning.
    The outer cylinder is wrapped in textured rubber to provide grip in slippery conditions such as the shower.
    The outer cylinder also has 3 vents to speed up drying.
    One of the end caps has a simple pressure valve to provide suction during use and can be placed over either end.
    The Arcwave Pow looks more like a portable speaker than a sextoy and is quite discrete. 
    The pow is currently avain 3 colors: black, blue and mint.

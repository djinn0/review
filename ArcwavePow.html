    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Pow is my favorite stroker.
    It feels good, has a modern design and is exceptionally durable. 
    It is great for a quick solo session, or as a tool during partnered play</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Pow is canister style stroker,
    composed of a soft textured silicone sleeve encased in a hard plastic cylinder.
    The Pow is 7 inches in length and 2.75 inches in diameter, 
    with a usable inner length of 6.5 inches. 
    The Pow has openings at both ends covered by removable caps,
    one opening is wider than the other providing different sensations.
    The sleeve has a uniform texture throughout of spiraling ridges, which are simple but very effective. 
    The inner sleeve can be removed from the cylinder for cleaning.
    The outer cylinder is wrapped in textured rubber to provide grip in slippery conditions such as the shower.
    The outer cylinder also has 3 vents to speed up drying.
    One of the end caps has a simple pressure valve to provide suction during use and can be placed over either end.
    The Arcwave Pow looks more like a portable speaker than a sextoy and is quite discrete. 
    The pow is currently available in 3 colors: black, blue and mint.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>For me I enjoy strokers most the first time I try them, the anticipation and excitement adds something to the experience.
    When the Arcwave Pow arrived I pulled it out of the shipping box checked out the packaging then put it away until the weekend so I could take my time trying it out.
    I thought that the Pow would be perfect for a edging because of the understated internal texture and minimal suction.
    I lay down on the couch ready for a long and relaxed solo session.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The inner sleeve is made with Arcwave's CleanTech soft silicone,
    which is smooth and squishy to the touch and feels amazing during use. 
    The external cylinder is made of ABS plastic which is durable and strong. 
    The inner sleeve has held up well to frequent use for over 6 months, and shows no signs of wear. 
    I accidentally used silicone lube once, after realizing my mistake I washed out the stroker which suffered no damage. 
    Although Silicone lube did not damage the sleeve during a single use, 
    water based lube is recommended, and silicone lube could cause damage with repeated use. 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Pow was attractively packaged in a cardboard cylinder. 
    The decoration on the packaging is simple, with a picture of the toy and minimal text. 
    The packaging is sturdy and can be reused to store the toy.
    The Pow costs $69.00 "nice!" on the Arcwave website,
    and is readily avalible from various stores which may have sales or offer discounts. 
    I think the Pow is reasonably priced for its quality, especially if it can be found on sale.

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Pow is my favorite stroker.
    It feels good, has a modern design and is exceptionally durable. 
    It is great for a quick solo session, or as a tool during partnered play</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Pow is canister style stroker,
    composed of a soft textured silicone sleeve encased in a hard plastic cylinder.
    The Pow is 7 inches in length and 2.75 inches in diameter, 
    with a usable inner length of 6.5 inches. 
    The Pow has openings at both ends covered by removable caps,
    one opening is wider than the other providing different sensations.
    The sleeve has a uniform texture throughout of spiraling ridges, which are simple but very effective. 
    The inner sleeve can be removed from the cylinder for cleaning.
    The outer cylinder is wrapped in textured rubber to provide grip in slippery conditions such as the shower.
    The outer cylinder also has 3 vents to speed up drying.
    One of the end caps has a simple pressure valve to provide suction during use and can be placed over either end.
    The Arcwave Pow looks more like a portable speaker than a sextoy and is quite discrete. 
    The Pow is available in 3 colors: black, blue and mint.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>
    <!--
    For me I enjoy strokers most the first time I try them, the anticipation and excitement adds something to the experience.
    When the Arcwave Pow arrived I pulled it out of the shipping box checked out the packaging then put it away until the weekend so I could take my time trying it out.
    -->
    The interier texture of the feels great, the silicone is the squishiest I have ever felt and quite stretchy.
    The uniform spiral nubs provide a nice sensation which subtlety build with every stroke. 
    The silicone is less slippery than TPE sleeves I have used and requires a lot of lube. There is a little friction until the lube gets spread across all the texture nubs.
    The Arcwave Pow has two different sized openings, I perfer the wider opening because there is less drag on insertion,
    and counterintuitively it has a tighter interior past the opening. 
    There is a valve on one of the caps to produce suction, but the sensation is so anemic it can barely be felt. <br>
    The first time I tried The Arcwave Pow I thought that it would be perfect for edging because of the understated internal texture and minimal suction.
    On my first use It brought me to orgasm quicker than I had anticipated, but as I have continued to use it and gotten used to the sensations, it has become a great toy for 
    edging and long relaxed solo sessions. note about wife using it on me.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The inner sleeve is made with Arcwave's CleanTech soft silicone,
    which is smooth and squishy to the touch and feels amazing during use. 
    The external cylinder is made of ABS plastic which is durable and strong. 
    The inner sleeve has held up well to frequent use for over 6 months, and shows no signs of wear. 
    I accidentally used silicone lube once, after realizing my mistake I washed out the stroker which suffered no damage. 
    Although Silicone lube did not damage the sleeve during a single use, 
    water based lube is recommended, and silicone lube could cause damage with repeated use. 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Arcwave Pow was attractively packaged in a cardboard cylinder. 
    The decoration on the packaging is simple, with a picture of the toy and minimal text. 
    The packaging is sturdy and can be reused to store the toy.
    The Pow costs $69.00 "nice!" on the Arcwave website,
    and is readily avalible from various stores which may have sales or offer discounts. 
    I think the Pow is reasonably priced for its quality, especially if it can be found on sale.

    <h1 class='title'>B-vibe Triplet Review</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>October 2024</h2>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Triplet is B-vibes modern take on anal beads.
    B-vibe is a North American manufacturer of premium anal pleasure products, and has extensive 
    experience designing vibrating toys. I previously reviewed the <a href=â€™>B-vibe Snug Plug</a>
    but this is my first time testing one of their vibrating offerings.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Triplet has three beads of ascending size from 0.8 to 1.2 inches connected by
    a flexible silicone shaft. The larger two beads have motors that vibrate.
    The Triplet has an anchor shaped base which houses the battery and controls, 
    The base is pretty comfortable when sitting between my cheeks, 
    but is a bit difficult to hold when thrusting the beads in and out. 
    The included remote controls vibration intensity and allows the user to select vibration patterns.
    There are 6 vibration intensities and 15 different vibration patterns.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>The B-vibe triplet is a relatively recent addition to my toy collection so I have only had the opportunity 
    to enjoy it a handful of times so far. The first time I tested the triplet I did not feel like warming up was necessary, because of the moderate size of the toy.
    I applied a generous measure of lube then inserted it. The first 2 beads slide in easily, the last and largest bead was slightly harder to get in, but it followed the other 2 beads without too much trouble. 
    The first time I tried the Triplet I used it as vibrating butt plug inserting it then leaving it in place.
    The toy felt pleasant enough while sitting or laying, the base is reasonably comfortable but the vibrations felt a bit muted.
    The vibrations feel much more intense while standing;
    I put in the plug to make washing up the dishes a little more exciting and I had to stop washing partway through to take care of myself.
    The next time I used the triplet I wanted to test the how well it performed as a set of beads.
    The beads are well sized and feel good as they slide in and out.
    The handle is small and difficult to grip making it harder to control the beads.
    I also found the Triplet to be a bit short and wished it had another couple of beads for thrusting.
    The Triplet works alright as set of beads but is a great vibrating butt plug. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The triplet has two motors, a battery, connecting wires, and a micro controller chip all encased in silicone.
    The silicone is relatively firm but does have a bit of flex. The silicone has a smooth matte surface, 
    that gets quite slick with a bit of water-based or oil-based lube. The motors are powerful for their size. 
    The batteries last for about two hour of use and recharge in three hours. </br>
    The Tripet feels like a premium toy. 
    The silicone is smooth without any defects or manufacturing marks, vibrations are rumbly and strong and it has good battery life.
    The remote is also a nice feature which improves the play experience.

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The Triplet seems relatively durable and well made. 
    I was a little worried that the wires in the flexible silicone shaft could break or become disconnected,
    but it has held up so far, and I have not read any any reports of them breaking. 
    The silicone is pretty tough and there are no small protrusions or details that could tear.
    The Triplet seems like it will last a while under normal use. I use the Triplet with a water-based lube.
    After use I wash the the toy with soap and hot water before sanitizing it with alcohol.
    Between uses I store the B-vibe Triplet in the included storage bag.

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The packaging of the Triplet is stylish and fun.
    The box it light pink with darker pink text and a white border giving it a fun slightly retro vibe.
    I like the vibrant colors and minimal text of the box styling, and I think it conveys an idea of whimsical and sensual fun.
    Inside the box there were fun stickers, a storage bag, a guide to anal play booklet in addition to the toy.
    </br>The Triplet costs $145 on bvibes website, it is also available from other retailers for about $10 cheaper.
    The Triplet is definitely more expensive than comparable toys, and on the high end of what I would be willing to pay.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>First off I loved the packaging and the bright pink color or the toy, it was a nice change from the dark, sensual and serious design of many other toys.
    I was pleasantly surprised with how strong and rumbly the vibrations were that the triplet produced.
    I like the remote, it makes controling the toy easy alowing me to choose the exact sensations I desire. 
    Although the base of The Triplet is comfortable, it is too small to grab limiting the functionality of the beads. 
    The Triplet is also on the expensive side for a toy with its features.
    The B-vibe Triplet, like many sex toys, loads of fun despite being imperfect.</p>

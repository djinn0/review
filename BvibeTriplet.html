    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Triplet is B-vibes modern take on anal beads.
    B-vibe is a North American manufacturer of premium anal pleasure products, and has extensive 
    extensive experience designing vibrating toys. </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Triplet has three beads of ascending size from 0.8 to 1.2 inches connected by
    a flexible silicone shaft. The larger two beads have The motors that vibrate.
    The Triplet has an anchor shaped base which houses the battery and controls, 
    The base is pretty comfortable when sitting between my cheeks, 
    but is a bit difficult to hold when thrusting the beads in and out. 
    The included remote controls vibration intensity and allows the user to select vibration patterns.
    There are 6 vibration intensitys and 4/x different vibration patterns.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>The B-vibe triplet is a relatively recent addition to my toy collection so I have only had the opportunity 
    to enjoy it a handful of times so far. The first time I tested the triplet I did not feel like warming up was necessary, because of the moderate size of the toy.
    I applied a generous measure of lube then inserted it. The first 2 beads slide in easily, the last and largest bead was slightly harder to get in, but it followed the other 2 beads without too much trouble. 
    The first time I tried the Triplet I used it as vibrating butt plug inserting it then leaving it in place.
    The toy felt pleasant enough while sitting or laying, the base is reasonably comfortable but the vibrations felt a bit muted.
    The vibrations feel much more intense while standing;
    I put in the plug to make washing up the dishes a little more exciting and I had to stop washing partway through to take care of myself.
    The next time I used the triplet I wanted to test the how well it performed as a set of beads.
    The beads are well sized and feel good as they slide in and out.
    The handle is small and difficult to grip making it harder to control the beads.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The triplet has two motors, a batery, connecting wires, and a micro controller chip all encased in silicone.
    The silicone is relatively firm but does have a bit of flex. The silicone has a smooth matte surface, 
    that gets quite slick with a bit of water-based or oil-based lube. The motors are powerful for their size. The batteries last  </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The Triplet seems relatively durable and well made. 
    I was a little worried that the wires in the flexible silicone shaft could break or become disconnected,
    but it has held up so far, and I have not read any any reports of them breaking.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Triplet costs $145 on bvibes website, it is also available for other retailers for about $10 cheaper.
    The Triplet is definitely more expensive than comparable toys, and on the high end of what I would be willing to pay.
    The packaging of the Triplet is excellent, </p>

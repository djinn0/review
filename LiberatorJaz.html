    <h1 class='title'>Liberator Jazz motion Review</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>July 2024</h2>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Liberator is a US based manufacture of furnature and intimate accessories. 
    Liberator is best known for their positioning wedges but also make sex furniture, harnesses, waterproof blankets, sex toys and other products.
    I have wanted to try a wedge for a while, but they are expensive and were always other toys I wanted to test more.
    When the Jaz Motion went in sale I decided it was time to buy a positioning pillow. </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Jaz Motion is one of the smaller wedges Liberator makes. 
    It is 19 inches in length, 12 inches in width and 6 inches thick at the widest point.
    The angle of the wedge is approximately 20 degrees.
    The Jazz motion has a curved side and a flat side. It can be used as a simple wedge with
    flat side down or it can enhance rocking motion when used with the curved side down. 
    It has a simple but effective design.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>My wife and I tested the Liberator Jaz Motion in multiple positions. 
    It enhanced some positions by making them more comfortable and increasing simulation.
    There were also a few positions we tried that did not work with the Liberator.</p>
    <p class='content'>Our favorite position we tried with the Liberator is butterfly. My wife lay at the edge of the bed with her legs spread and I stood between her legs. 
    We usually need a pillow in this position to lift her hips to right height for penetration. 
    The Jaz offered a lot more support than a normal pillow, it also changed her hip angle providing us both with increased stimulation.</p>
    <p class='content'>Our least favorite position with the Liberator wedge was doggy style. 
    The pillow got in the way preventing my partner from using her wand, and it put her hips lower than usual making the position less pleasurable for me.</p>
    <p class='content'>The Liberator worked well for cowgirl, normally we do reverse cowgirl because it is a better angle for our individual anatomies.
    The wedge was comfortable under my lower back</p>
    <p class='content'>We tried using the Liberator for Oral sex.</p>
    <p class='content'>I tried the Liberator during a solo masturbating sesh.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Liberator Jazz motion is made with high density polyurethane foam
    which is soft enough to be comfortable but much firmer and supportive than a normal pillow.
    The Jazz has a microsuede cover that is soft to the touch and machine washable. 
    The cover has a water-resistant liner that protects the pillow from moisture and makes clean-up easy.
    The cover has a beefy zipper and us thick and feels very durable.
    The Liberator feels well made, and is as good quality as I expected.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The Polyurethane foam that is at the core of the Liberator Jazz Motion is extremely Durable.
    Polyurethane foam is long lasting, resists moisture, withstands mechanical stress and was even used to 
    insulate the fuel tank of the space shuttle. The cover also seems quite sturdy with thick fabric and a strong zipper.
    The pillow usually stays pretty clean, but I am glad that the cover is machine washable if things get a bit messy.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Jaz Motion costs $120 on the Liberator website. 
    During Liberators memorial day sale it was on sale for half off making it a reasonable $60. 
    The pillow was shipped in a discrete brown cardboard box. 
    The inside of the box was white with liberator branding in red, stickers, a post card and a small catalog 
    The Jaz was vacuumed packed to conserve space. I think the box with a plain exterier and stylish interior 
    is a clever way to reduce shipping materials and environmental impact while still providing an exciting experience when the box is opened.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>I am glad that I finally got a Liberator wedge, it lived up to my expectations.
    I am slightly disappointed that the foam was not firm enough to effectively rock, so I was unable to fully enjoy all the features of the Jaz's design.
    I think the Jaz is a good size, it is large enough to use effectively but small enough to easily store.

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Liberator is a US based manufacture of furnature and intimate accessories. 
    Liberator is best known for their positioning wedges but also make sex furniture, harnesses, waterproof blankets, sex toys and other products.
    I have wanted to try a wedge for a while, but they are expensive and were always other toys I wanted to test more.
    When the Jaz Motion went in sale I decided it was time to buy a positioning pillow. </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Jaz Motion is one of the smaller wedges Liberator makes. 
    It is 19 inches in length, 12 inches in width and 6 inches thick at the widest point.
    The angle of the wedge is approximately 20 degrees.
    The Jazz motion has a curved side and a flat side. It can be used as a simple wedge with
    flat side down or it can enhance rocking motion when used with the curved side down. 
    It has a simple but effective design.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>My wife and I tested the Liberator Jaz Motion in multiple positions. 
    It improved some positions enhancing stimulation and making them more comfortable. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Liberator Jazz motion is made with high density polyurethane foam
    which is soft enough to be comfortable but much firmer and supportive than a normal pillow.
    The Jazz has a microsuede cover that is soft to the touch and machine washable. 
    The cover has a water-resistant liner that protects the pillow from moisture and makes clean-up easy.
    The cover has a beefy zipper and us thick and feels very durable.
    The Liberator feels well made, and is as good quality as I expected.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The Polyurethane foam that is at the core of the Liberator Jazz Motion is extremely Durable.
    Polyurethane foam is long lasting, resists moisture, withstands mechanical stress and was even used to 
    insulate the fuel tank of the space shuttle. The cover also seems quite sturdy with thick fabric and a strong zipper.
    The pillow usually stays pretty clean, but I am glad that the cover is machine washable if things get a bit messy.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Jaz Motion costs $120 on the Liberator website. 
    During Liberators memorial day sale it was on sale for half off making it a reasonable $60. 
    The pillow was shipped in a discrete brown cardboard box. 
    The inside of the box was white with liberator branding in red, stickers, a post card and a small catalog 
    The Jaz was vacuumed packed to conserve space. I think the box with a plain exterier and stylish interior 
    is a clever way to reduce shipping materials and environmental impact while still providing an exciting experience when the box is opened.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Doxy is a small toy company based in Cornwall England. Doxy is best known for their powerful wand vibrators.
    My Wife is currently extremely happy with her Le Wand petite so none of their toys were really on my radar. 
    While perusing my local toy shop I came across one of their metal plugs. </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The plug has a tapered egg shape with a long narrow neck and a circular base.
    There are small ribbs at the bottom of the plug body. The plug has a max diameter of 1.3 inches and an insertable length of 2.75 inches.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Doxy Ribbed Butt Plug is milled out of a block of solid aluminum. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The Plug is very durable. 
    Aluminum is corrosion resistant and very strong for its weight.
    It is unlikely to be damaged during any reasonable use.
    After use I clean and sanitize the plug the put it back in its case. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The packaging is subtlety stylish with white text on a black background and a picture of the toy. 
    Inside the box is a machined aluminum storage cylinder the perfectly fits.
    I am usually pretty happy if storage bag is included with a toy, so I was ecstatic that it came with a custom
    fit metal case. The metal storage cylinder is definitely the coolest extra I have ever gotten with a toy, and elevated the whole experience.
    </br>The Ribbed Butt Plug costs $49.99 on the Doxy website</p>

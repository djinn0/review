    <h1 class='title'>Doxy Ribbed Butt Plug Review.</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>September 2024</h2>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Doxy is a small toy company based in Cornwall England, where they design and manufacture all their products in house.
    Doxy is best known for their powerful wand vibrators.
    My Wife is currently extremely happy with her Le Wand petite and not as enthusiastic about trying new toys as me, so none of their toys were really on my radar. 
    One day while perusing my local adult toy shop I came across one of their metal plugs. I loved the design and knew that I needed to try it.
    I jumped on the Doxy website and ordered a ribbed plug that evening.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The plug has a tapered egg shape with a long narrow neck and a circular base.
    There are small ribbs at the bottom of the plug body. The plug has a max diameter of 1.3 inches and an insertable length of 2.75 inches. 
    The moderate size and long narrow neck make the plug relatively comfortable for extended wear. The Doxy logo is engraved in the base.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Doxy Ribbed Butt Plug is milled out of a block of solid aluminum.
    Aluminum is a somewhat rare material for sex toys, and is used significantly less frequently than stainless steel or silicone. 
    Aluminum is strong, relatively light weight and very heat conductive making this plug an excellent choice for temperature play.
    The quality of the plug is excellent, there are no machining marks from the manufacturering process.
    The metal is polished and has a shiny mirror finish.

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The Plug is very durable. 
    Aluminum is corrosion resistant and very strong for its weight.
    It is unlikely to be damaged during any reasonable use.
    After use I clean, sanitize  the plug with soap, warm water and alcohol. 
    After cleaning I wipe the plug dry and put it back in its case. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The packaging is subtlety stylish with white text on a black background and a picture of the toy. 
    Inside the box is a machined aluminum storage cylinder the perfectly fits.
    I am usually pretty happy if storage bag is included with a toy, so I was ecstatic that it came with a custom
    fit metal case. The metal storage cylinder is definitely the coolest extra I have ever gotten with a toy, and elevated the whole experience.
    </br>The Ribbed Butt Plug costs $49.99 on the Doxy website, which I feel is a reasonable price for a quality metal plug. 
    I got mine for 30% off on one of Doxy's frequent flash sales. If you are patient and check the website regularly it is possible to get a great discount on the toy.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Comparison to Njoy Pure Plug</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Doxy Ribbed plug is somewhat reminicent of the <a href=NjoyPurePlug.html>Njoy Pure Plug</a>
    which I have previously tested and reviewed. Quality Metal Plugs from reputable manufactures are somewhat rare.
    The Doxy plug has a straighter classic design and is easier to insert. The Pure Plug has a curved design and
    is significantly heavier due to being made out of stainless steel rather than aluminum.
    Both plugs are cold to the touch but quickly warm to body temperature and are good tools for temperature play.
    The Doxy plug has a uniform rounded base the Pure plug has a narrower elongated base, 
    for me personally the doxy base is more comfortable especially while sitting.
    Both plugs came in fancy packaging that doubles as storage, I like the Doxy machined aluminum tube better than Njoy's pink satin lined box.
    The Doxy plug is manufactured in a local factory in Cornwall Uk; My Njoy Pure plug was manufactured in China.
    The Pure Plug feels more intense after it is inserted than the Doxy, the doxy is a bit subtler due to its lighter weight and design.. 
    I thoroughly enjoy both plugs, and I hope the Doxy Ribbed plug achieves the same cult status as The Njoy Pure plugs.

    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Cone Small is made of medical grade silicone. 
    The surface has a matte texture. It comes in two colors, crimson red or onyx black.
    The silicone is relatively firm, it holds but has a bit of flex. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Being made of pure silicone the Cone is very durable.
    The Cone is quite thick so it is unlikely to be damaged in any way during use. 
    After use I clean the Cone with warm water and antibacteral soap then allow it to dry so it is ready for next time.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>I usually buy toys because they have an exciting or unique design, and
    I anticipate that they will be pleasurable to use.
    I purchased the Tantus Cone Small not for pleasure but to use as a tool to help me as I train to use larger toys.
    I was a bit ambitious when shopping recently and have aquired some toys that are too large for me to currently use. 
    I started looking for a toy to use as an anal stretching aid when I came across the Tantus Cone.
    I have a few Tantus toys in my collection and I have been pleased with their quality and designs so I decided to give the Cone a go.

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Cone is a tapered cone, with a prominent circular base and a rounded tip. 
    It is designed as a training toy for anal stretching (it is probably a bit long for vaginal use.)
    It is 8 inches in length, with a tip 0.7 inchs in diameter that increases to 2.0 inches.
    It has a large rounded base providing stability and safety.
    The Tantus website lists that the Cone is both anal safe and harness compatible.
    I am glad that the Cone is designed to be anal safe because that is my intended use, but it is not a toy that I would personally use or enjoy with a harness.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Cone Small is doing exactly what I purchased it for; it is safely and comfortably stretching me so I can try bigger toys.
    I have been using it for approximately 4 weeks every other day for 10 to 20 minutes. 
    After focused effort over a few sessions I was finally able to get the Cone all the way in
    I like how easy it is to prepare for a session, I apply a generous measure of a thick water based lube then start working it in. 
    The tip is narrow enough that I can insert it without needing to warm-up with another toy first. 
    I insert the toy as far as I can, then wait as my sphincter relaxes and then push the cone a little farther, 
    I repeat this process until I feel like I have gotten an adequate stretch and start to feel tired.
    When I was finally able to get the cone all the way it became the perfect warm-up toy when I finally got the Cone all of the way in.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Cone Small is made of medical grade silicone. 
    The surface has a matte texture. It comes in two colors, crimson red or onyx black.
    The silicone is relatively firm, it holds its shape but has a bit of flex. 
    The Quality of the cone is excellent which is no surprise because Tantuse has been oroducing silicone toys for ages. 
    The surface has a uniform texture, there is no pitting or seams, and the color is vibrant.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Being made of pure silicone the Cone is very durable.
    The Cone is quite thick so it is unlikely to be damaged in any way during use. 
    After use I clean the Cone with warm water and antibacteral soap then allow it to dry so it is ready for next time.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Cone was shipped in a discrete bubble-envelope.
    The toy itself was packaged in a basic brown cardboard box with a sticker which had a picture and a few details about the toy. 
    It was not the most impressive packaging I have seen but I purchesed the Tantus cone for the toy not the box.
    The Tantus Cone small costs $47.00 on the Tantus website, it is also avalible from other adult product retailers.
    I purchased the Cone during a fall flash sale for 50% of retail so I got it for $23.50. 
    Even at full price the Tantus Cone small is reasonably costed, at 11 oz it is a substantial hunk of premium silicone.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Cone is definitely not the most fun or exciting toy in my collection but it fulfills an important role.
    I would recommend the Cone to anyone who has moderate experience with anal play and would like to size up.
    I like how easy it is to use, the feel of the silicone and the sturdy base. 
    I feel it is a bit long and wish it had a slightly more aggressive taper. </p>

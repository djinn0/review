    <h1 class='title'>Affiliate Info</h1>
    <h2 class='content'>Disclosure</h2>
    <p class='content'>This website uses affiliate links.
    Affiliate links are personalized web links assigned to bloggers, influencers and content creators.
    If a person purchases a product after clicking an affiliate link, the content creator is paid a percentage of the sale.
    Affiliate programs provide content creators with an income stream in exchange for connecting viewers and companies.
    I primarily use affiliate income to purchase toys for review, and to maintain the site. 
    </p>

    <h1 class='title'>List of Links</h1>
    <p class='content'>I only join affiliate programs for companies that I like and feel comfortable promoting.
    and that do not add any additional costs.
    This list will be updated with new affiliate links and outdated links will be removed periodically to ensure the list is current.
     </p>

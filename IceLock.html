    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Ice locks are a time release mechanism used in self bondage.
    Restraints are attached to an ice lock, the ice melts releasing the restraints after a period of time.
    Self bondage is a bit of a niche activity so there are few manufacturers actively making self bondage toys and supplies.
    Eisschloss is an Etsy store that specializes in making ice locks in various sizes;
    It appears to be a one man operation based in Germany.
    The owner is friendly and responsive and answered all my questions, so I was confinement I would be getting a great product before making an order.

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>An ice lock is a simple time release mechanism used for self bondage.
    It has 2 parts a cylinder and a pin. The cylinder is filled with water and then the pin is inserted and the lock is frozen.
    The frozen water locks the pin in place preventing it from moving until the ice melts.
    The pin has holes which help the ice grip the pin better.
    There is a dranage hole in the side of the lock that allows excess water to flow out when the pin is inserted. 
    There are rings on the bottom of the cylinder and on the pin that act as attachment points for restraints. 
    Larger cylinders take longer to melt allowing for different release times based on size.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>Having a safe and reliable release method is one of the most important aspects of self bondage.
    Melting Ice is frequently used because it is simple, easily acessable, and does not require electronics or complicated devices. 
    An ice lock was top of my wish list when I started experimenting with self bondage. </br>
    
    The first time I used the the smaller Ice Lock I filled it top with water than inserted the pin. 
    The water expanded as it froze forcing the lock pin half way out of the cylinder. 
    The pin was still secure enough to use, but the lock melted faster because the pin was already half way out of the cylinder. 
    The next time I used the Ice Lock I carefully filled the lock with 15ml measured with a syringe, and had better results.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The ice locks are machined from stainless steel.
    Stainless steel is an excellent material for an ice lock, as it does not rust, it is body safe,
    and it is a reasonable heat conductor so the ice will melt at a predictable rate. 
    The ice locks are of reasonably good quality for a small manufacturer. 
    They are very robust and durable.  
    There are machining marks and welds that show that the ice locks are hand made,
    but the welds are small a neat and the steel has been nicely polished. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>I expect the ice locks will be quite durable being made from stainless steel.
    Stainless steal is extreamly strong compared to other materials often used in sex toys, and will not rust in normal conditions.
    I have only had them for a few weeks but so far they do not show any sign of wear or damage and will likely look almost new my whole life.
    The ice locks are very easy to care for, after use I wipe them out and allow them to air dry before putting them away.
    Using the ice lock does require some planning because they need to be frozen before use.
    Sometimes I will refill and refreeze the lock after use and leave it in the freezer so it is ready for next use.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Shipping, Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The ice locks were shipped in an a discret box and packaged in satin storage bag.
    There was also a thank you not from the store owner in the box.
    The basic lock costs $33.25 and the 2.5 hour lock costs $68.83
    shipping costs an additional ~$30. Because the ice locks were made to order then shipped from Germany it took them a few weeks to arrive. </br> 
    Ice locks are a niche item so there is limited selection of locks avalible from a handful of small manufacturers.
    The ice Locks from Eisschloss are some of the least expensive I have found, and are excellent quality for the price. 
    They may not be a toy for everyone, but they are perfect for exploring self bondage. </p>

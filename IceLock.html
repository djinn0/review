    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Ice locks are a time release mechanism used in self bondage.
    Restraints are attached to an ice lock, the ice melts releasing the restraints after a period of time.
    Self bondage is a bit of a niche activity so there are few manufacturers actively making self bondage toys and supplies.

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>An ice lock is a simple time release mechanism used for self bondage.
    It has 2 parts a cylinder and a pin. The cylinder is filled with water 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The ice locks are machined from stainless steel.
    Stainless steel is an excellent material for an ice lock, it does not rust, it is body safe,
    and it is a reasonable heat conductor so the ice will melt at a predictable rate. 
    The ice locks are reasonably good quality for a small manufacturer. 
    There are machining marks and welds that show that the ice locks are hand made,
    but the welds are small a neat and the steel has been nicely polished. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>I expect the ice locks will be quite durable 
    being made from stainless steel. I have only had them for a few weeks but they have held up to use excellently so far.
    The ice locks are very easy to care for, after use I wipe them out and allow them to air dry before putting them away.
    Using the ice lock does require some planning because they need to be frozen first before use.
    Sometimes I will refreeze the lock after use and leave it in the freezer so it is ready for next use.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The basic lock costs $33.25 and the 2.5 hour lock costs $68.83
    shipping costs an additional ~$30. 
    Ice locks are a niche item so there are only limited selection of locks avalible from a handful of small manufacturers.
    The ice Locks from Eisschloss are some of the least expensive I have found, and are excellent quality for the price.</p>

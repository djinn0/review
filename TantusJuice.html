    <h1 class='title'>Tantus Juice Review</h1>
  
    <div class='content'><img src='image1.jpg' alt='placeholder image' class='picture'></div>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Juice is the oldest plug currently in my collection, and the first quality plug I purchased from a known manufacturer
    (I made the usual mistake of purchasing cheap brandless things during my first foray into the wonderful world of sex toys). 
    The Juice has a pleasant shape and is made with superb mat silicone.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tantus juice is a medium sized plug, 4 inches in length and 1.4 inches in diameter.
      It has a smooth tapered shape which makes it easy to insert and pull out.
      The plug has vertical ribs, they do not provide additional sensation on insertion but they can definitely be felt if the plug is twisted.
      The vertical ribs also hold lube. The neck is large enough to provide a comfortable stretching sensation after insertion but not so large that the plug becomes uncomfortable.
      The Juice has an anchor shaped base that sits comfortably between the cheeks.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'> The Juice is made with Tantus’ high quality silicone blend.
      It has a matte finish which is slick when lubed but doesn’t attract lint.
      The silicone is firm enough that it doesn’t bend much when the plug in inserted but the plug is a little squishy to the touch. 
      The neck and anchor base feels more pliable than the bulb. The silicone doesn't retain smells after use, and is easy to clean. 
      The silicone is quite durable, I have had the Tantus Juice Plug for over a year and it does not show any sign of wear. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'> The Juice, like most Tantus products, came in a clear plastic box. 
      The packaging is simple but effective, it  highlights the plug and can be disposed of discreetly.
      The Juice costs $31 on Tantus’ website which is a reasonable price for a quality plug.  </p>

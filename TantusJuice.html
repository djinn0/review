    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Juice is the oldest plug currently in my collection, and the first quality plug I purchased from a known manufacturer
    (I made the usual mistake of purchasing cheap brandless things during my first foray into the wonderful world of sex toys). 
    The Juice has a great shape and is made with superb matte silicone.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Tantus juice is a medium sized plug, 4 inches in length and 1.4 inches in diameter.
      It has a smooth tapered shape which makes it easy to insert and pull out.
      The plug has vertical ribs, they can not be felt when the Juice is inserted but they provide some sensation if the plug is twisted.
      The vertical ribs also hold lube. The neck is large enough to provide a comfortable stretching sensation after insertion but not so large that the plug becomes uncomfortable.
      The Juice has an anchor shaped base that sits comfortably between the cheeks.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>The tapered symmetrical shape of the Tantus Juice makes it easy to insert and extract.
    I cannot feel the ribs when I insert plug or when it is in, but the ribs do retain lube.
    The Juice is big enough to provide me with a pleasurable full sensation, but it is not too intense. 
    The plug does provide moderate prostate pressure which increases as I become more aroused.
    It stays in place during sex for me, and I've never been concerned that it would pop out even from strong muscle contractions during orgasm.
    The Tantus Juice is the most used plug in my collection, I use it to warm up for other toys or on its own during solo play and sex.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'> The Juice is made with Tantus’ high quality silicone blend.
      It has a matte finish which is slick when lubed but doesn’t attract lint.
      The silicone is firm enough that it doesn’t bend much when the plug in inserted but the plug is a little squishy to the touch. 
      The neck and anchor base feels more pliable than the bulb. The silicone doesn't retain smells after use, and is easy to clean. 
      The silicone is quite durable, I have had the Tantus Juice Plug for over a year and it does not show any sign of wear. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'> The Juice, like most Tantus products, came in a clear plastic box. 
      The packaging is simple but effective, it  highlights the plug and can be disposed of discreetly.
      The Juice costs $31 on Tantus’ website which is a reasonable price for a quality plug.  </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Reviews</h2>
    <p class='content'>I do not accept monetary payment for my reviews.
    I do accept free or discounted items from creators, retailers and manufactures in exchange for providing honest review of the products.
    If an item was provided free of charge it will be noted within the review. 
    I strive to remain impartial while reviewing items and receiving free items does not influence my opinion.
    Many of the Items that I review are part of my personal collection or purchased because I found them intriguing. My reviews are based off my own personal experience, and the personal experience of my partner (e.g. vaginal, clitoral, and couplesâ€™ toys). 
    I strive to be as honest, genuine, and informative as possible in my reviews. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Affiliate programs and Advertisements </h2>
    <p class='content'>I do not have any affiliate programs currently. My primary focus is on producing quality content and increasing readership, I may set up affiliate programs at a future date.
    I currently do not have any advertising on my website;  my website is a static page so I can not run server supported advertising, and I do not like the look of pop-up and banner advertisements.
    I may add minimal, aesthetically pleasing advertising in the future if I receive sponsorship, but this is not a course I am actively pursuing. 
    My operations costs for hosting this website are minimal, I do not need money from affiliate programs or advertising to cover operating costs. 
    My main expenses are the the cost of buying new toys to try, and the time it takes to thoroughly test new products and write reviews.

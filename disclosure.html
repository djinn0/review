    <h2 class='content'>Content</h2>
    <p class='content'>All content contained within this website is my own creation.  </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Reviews</h2>
    <p class='content'>I do not accept monetary payment for my reviews.
    I do accept free or discounted items from creators, retailers and manufactures in exchange for an honest review of the product.
    If an item was provided free of charge in exchange this will be noted within the review. 
    I strive to remain impartial while reviewing items and receiving free items does not influence my opinion.
    Many of the Items that I review are part of my personal collection or purchased because I found them intriguing. My reviews are based off my own personal experience, and the personal experience of my partner (e.g. vaginal, clitoral, and couplesâ€™ toys). 
    I strive to be as honest, genuine, and informative as possible in my reviews. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Affiliate programs and Advertisements </h2>
    <p class='content'>I have not set up affiliate programs set up. My primary focus is on producing quality content and increasing readership, but I may set up affiliate programs at a future date.
    I currently do not have any advertising on my website; I do not like the look of banner and pop-up advertisements, and because my website is a static page I can not run server supported advertising anyways.
    I may add minimal, aesthetically pleasing advertising in the future if I receive sponsorship, but this is not a course I am actively pursuing. 
    My operations costs for hosting this website are minimal, and I do not need money from affiliate programs or advertising to cover the costs. 
    My main expenses are the time it takes to thoroughly test products and write reviews, and the cost of buying new toys to test.        </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Hot Octopus is a London based toy company that was founded to produce vibrators designed 
    specifically for males. Hot Octopus has since expanded their toy offerings producing innovative and inclusive toys.
    The Pulse Duo is based on the original Penis specific design of the pulse line of toys, but includes an extra motor and remote for use with a partner.

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>Hot Octopus describes the Pulse as a guybrator a vibrator specifically designed for use with a penis.
    It has silicone wings that wrap around the shaft, holding the vibration plate to the frenulum for maximum sensation. 
    The wings a top of the bibrator are ribbed for additional stimulation.
    The Pulse has buttons on both sides which control the vibration pattern and intensity.
    The bottom of the Pulse is a curved plastic plate with a second motor for stimulating a partner. 
    The second motor is controlled by a remote.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Hot Octopus pulse Duo has two ribbed silicone wings 
    which connect to the hard plastic body of the toy. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'> The Pulse Duo was packaged in a blue and black box with white detailing and text. 
    The packaging is stylish, but the cardboard is thinner and the packaging feels cheaper than other toys in a similar price range I have tried.
    In the box was the vibrator, a charging chord, remote control, storage bag, and instruction manual.
    The Pulse Duo retails for $149.95 on the Hot Octopus website, which is comparably priced to similar toys like the Fun Factory Manta. 
    I like how the Pulse Duo feels, but I do not think that the couples features add much. I wished I saved $50 and just got the Pulse Solo instead of the Duo.

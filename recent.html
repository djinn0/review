   <div class='awesome'>
     <div class='tight'><img src='photo/tantus/Ryder1.jpg'></div>
     <p class='contentS'>I started my blog a year ago with a review of the <a href='TantusJuice.html'>Tantus Juice Plug</a>,
     today I am celebrating one year by reviewing the Ryder another offering from Tantus. 
     The Ryder is an intermediate butt plug with similar dimensions to the Juice but has a more rounded shape.
     Founded in 1998 Tantus is a fixture of the adult toy industry. 
     They produce a varity of toys and helped popularize the use of body-safe silicone. 
     The Ryder is one of their classic toy designs, it underwent a redesign a few years ago where a narrower more ergonomic base was added.</p>

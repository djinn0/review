    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>content</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Oxballs Ergo Plug eschews the traditional tappered tip of most buttplugs, it is and squat with
    a rounded top. The ergo has a rounded kidney bean shaped bulb, a thick neck and a chuncky oval base.
    The Ergo plug small has a maximum width of 1.7 inches, an insertable length of 3 inches and a total length of 4 inches.
    Although my plug is the size small, it is the wides plug I own.
    The ergo line is intended for experienced users, and has plugs in 5 sizes up the extra large which is a massive 2.7 inches in diameter.  
    The plugs curved shape is designed to put gentle pressure on the prostate of users who have one.
    The Ergo plug is made with exceptionally squishy silicone making ideal for gentle stretching and comfortable for extended wear.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>The first thing I noticed about the Ergo plug is how squishy and soft the silicone is. 
    My plug is the smoke color which is oxballs softest silicone blend. 
    It feels amazing when squeezed I almost wanted to leave it on my desk next to my Rubik's cube as a stressball.
    I knew that the Ergo Plug would be difficult for me to insert due to its width and lack of taper.
    I warmed up with my trusted <a href="url">Juice Plug</a>, then I got in the shower, where the warm water helped me relax.
    It took a few tries to insert the plug, it kept bending at the neck. I adjusted my grip holding the plug near the tip and it finally slid into my butt.
    The relief and excitement of the getting the plug in combined with the intense pressure it put on my prostate caused me to orgasm immediately, 
    the first and only time I have orgasmed from prostate stimulation alone. I left the plug in for 15 more min minutes enjoying the gentle stretching
    sensation of the of the plug's substantial neck. 
    I don't use the Ergo plug much due to my laziness and how difficult it is to insert, but I always thoroughly enjoy the experience when I do.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Ergo plug is made with Oxball's premium blend of platinum silicone.
    Oxballs makes plugs in 4 silicone blends of different softness. My plug is made of the softest blend, 
    and it is the squishiest silicone I have ever felt. Due to the silicones softness the plug can be somewhat difficult to insert,
    but it feels amazing once it is finally in. The plug had a shiny surface which is somewhat sticky to the touch 
    but it gets quite slick with a bit of lube. The Ergo plug is a well thought out product from a small manufacturer.

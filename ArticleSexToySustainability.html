    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>As the Sex Toy industry continues to grow sustainability of toys is becoming an increasing concern.
    Top Manufacturers have worked to be more environmentally friendly by reducing packaging materials, designing toys with rechargeable batteries,
    improving manufacturering processes to reduce waste and using greener materials like metal and glass.</p>

    
    <h2 class='content'>Electronic toys</h2>
    <p class='content'>The downside of electronic toys is that they have a limited lifespan because eventually the batteries or motor will wear out making them unusable.

      <li><b>Do not share toys</b>
        <ul>
          <li>This is the simplest method of avoiding HPV transmission. A toy can not transmit HPV to another person if it is not shared.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Get Vaccinated</b>
      	<ul>
          <li>A safe and effective vaccine has been developed against the most dangerous subtypes of HPV. The CDC recomends vaccination for everyone age 12-26. 
          The CDC also recommends adults older than 26 who have a higher risk of HPV infection get vaccinated.
          Vaccination protects against high risk strains that could be contracted during sex or through sharing toys.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>Use a condom or other barrier </b>
      	<ul>
          <li>HPV is transmited through skin-to-skin or surface-to-skin contact. A Condom can act as a barrier preventing virus transference from a contaminated surface.
          Condoms are more effective at preventing HPV infection on sex toys than in partnered sex because they can completely cover the toy providing an effective barrier.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>Thoroughly clean sex toys</b>
      	<ul>
          <li>Soap and water do not deactivate HPV but they can wash it off of a surface. Sex toys should be washed after use to remove microbes and keep them clean and sanitary.
          Thoroughly scrubbing a sex toy with soap and water can remove HPV from the surface reducing the risk of transmission.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>UV Sterilization </b>
      	<ul>
          <li>UV sterilization has been shown to be effective at deactivating HPV and decontaminating surfaces. 
          After discovering that standard cleaning procedures were ineffective at deactivating HPV most Obstetrician and Gynecologist offices switched to using UV light
          to sterilize their tools. If UV is effective at sterilizing medical tools it should also be fairly effective at sterilizing sex toys.
          Bvibe sells a <a href='https://www.bvibe.com/uv-sterilizer-pouch.html'>UV sterilizer</a> designed specifically for sex toys that could be effective at deactivating HPV.</li>
        </ul>

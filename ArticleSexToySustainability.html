    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>As the Sex Toy industry continues to grow, sustainability is becoming an increasing concern.
    Top Manufacturers have worked to be more environmentally friendly by reducing packaging materials, designing toys with rechargeable batteries,
    improving manufacturering processes to reduce waste, and using greener materials like metal and glass. 
    Sustainability improvements in manufacturing do not address the problem of what happens to Sex Toys when they are no longer usable.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
    <p class='content'><i>Reduce:</i>To reduce toy waste purchase quality toys that you plan to keep.
    Research toys and before purchasing to save money and ensure you are happy with the product.</p>
    <p class='content'><i>Reuse:</i>Try to purchase multi-use toys that can be used again and again rather then single use toys that are disposed of after one use.
    Body-Safe toys made out of Silicone, metal, or glass are sterilizable so they are safe to resale or give away.</p>
    <p class='content'><i>Recycle:</i>Depending on the material some toys can be recycled. Check with your local recycling center to see what they can accept. 
    Some retailers have recycling programs where they work with specialty recycling centers equiped to deal with sex toys. 
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Electronic toys</h2>
    <p class='content'>The downside of electronic toys is that they have a limited lifespan because the batteries or motor will eventually wear out making them unusable.
    There are robust recycling programs for electronics because of their prevalence in our lives and because of the high value of the metals they contain.
    Unfortunately some recycling centers may not be equipped to recycle the non-electronic components of sex toys. Check with your local recycling center before sending them any toys. 
    It is also possible to remove the electronics from discarded toys and recycle them separately.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Metal toys</h2>
    <p class='content'>Quality metal toys are usually made with stainless steel. 
    Stainless steel and other metals are widely recycled, 
    and most recycling centers accept scrap metal including retired sex toys.
    Recycled metal is melted down and purified, then It can be made into something else without any loss of quality</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Glass toys</h2>
    <p class='content'>Glass can be melted down and remade without any material degradation so it is perfect for recycling.
    glasses usually retains their color during recycling so glass is often collected by color. 
    Some recycling centers have optical sorters or make items, like glass fiber insulation, where color does not matter, so sorting is sometimes not necessary.
    Glass recycling programs vary by region with some European countries recycling over 90% of glass to some countries that do not recycle glass at all. 
    Heat-resistant glass such as borosilicate glass or pyrex cannot be recycled with normal glass because it requires a much higher temperature to melt,
    and its inclusion can change the viscosity and other properties of the melted glass. Many higher-end glass sex toys are made with borosilicate glass so check
    the you and with your local recycling center before attempting to recycle glass sex toys. even if a glass sex toy cannot be recycled it is still a better choice than plastic
    because it does not degrade and leach chemicals or break down into micro-plastic</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Silicone</h2>
    <p class='content'>Silicone is a flexible polymer made of silicon, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. 
    All off these elements are abundant in the environment, but silicone has strong chemical bonds which prevent it from decomposing into its component elements.

     <ul class='content'>
      <li><b>Do not share toys</b>
        <ul>
          <li>This is the simplest method of avoiding HPV transmission. A toy can not transmit HPV to another person if it is not shared.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Get Vaccinated</b>
      	<ul>
          <li>A safe and effective vaccine has been developed against the most dangerous subtypes of HPV. The CDC recomends vaccination for everyone age 12-26. 
          The CDC also recommends adults older than 26 who have a higher risk of HPV infection get vaccinated.
          Vaccination protects against high risk strains that could be contracted during sex or through sharing toys.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>Use a condom or other barrier </b>
      	<ul>
          <li>HPV is transmited through skin-to-skin or surface-to-skin contact. A Condom can act as a barrier preventing virus transference from a contaminated surface.
          Condoms are more effective at preventing HPV infection on sex toys than in partnered sex because they can completely cover the toy providing an effective barrier.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>Thoroughly clean sex toys</b>
      	<ul>
          <li>Soap and water do not deactivate HPV but they can wash it off of a surface. Sex toys should be washed after use to remove microbes and keep them clean and sanitary.
          Thoroughly scrubbing a sex toy with soap and water can remove HPV from the surface reducing the risk of transmission.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>UV Sterilization </b>
      	<ul>
          <li>UV sterilization has been shown to be effective at deactivating HPV and decontaminating surfaces. 
          After discovering that standard cleaning procedures were ineffective at deactivating HPV most Obstetrician and Gynecologist offices switched to using UV light
          to sterilize their tools. If UV is effective at sterilizing medical tools it should also be fairly effective at sterilizing sex toys.
          Bvibe sells a <a href='https://www.bvibe.com/uv-sterilizer-pouch.html'>UV sterilizer</a> designed specifically for sex toys that could be effective at deactivating HPV.</li>

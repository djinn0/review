          I also review Clitoral toys, Vaginal toys, and Couples toys
          with help and input from my wife. 
          I only use and review insertable toys that are made from body safe materials 
          ( e.g. Silicone, Stainless steel and Glass. )
          I prefer non anatomical toys

          <p class='contentS'>Currently my favorite Buttplug is the <a href='TantusJuice.html'>Tantus Juice Plug</a>, it is easy to insert and comfortably filling. <br>

          My Wife's favorite toy currently is the Le Wand petite, it produces powerful distributed vibrations and isn't to heavy to hold for a long session.

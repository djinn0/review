        <summary>What toys do you review?</summary>
        <div>
          <p>I primarily review Anal toys and Penis toys from my personal collection. 
          I also review Clitoral toys, Vaginal toys, and Couples toys
          with help and input from my wife. 
          I only use and review insertable toys that are made from body safe materials 
          such as Silicone, Stainless steel and Glass.
          I prefer non anatomical toys

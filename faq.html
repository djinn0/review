        <summary>How did you get started?</summary>
        <div>
          <p class='contentS'>I started working on a blog to teach myself website design.
          Originally the blog was about recipes and food, I lost interest pretty quickly and stopped working on it.
          After a year I returned to the project to refresh my coding and website design skills.
          I started writing about sex toys which I found far more engaging to write about than food even though I like both.</p>

        <summary>What are your toy preferences?</summary>
        <div>
          <p class='contentS'> I like toys in bright colors and interesting textures. I love toys that are easy to clean and maintain.
          I like innovative design that produces unique sensations. I like rumbly vibrations, medium sized buttplugs, tight strokers and squishy silicone.
          I generally do not like toys with super realistic anatomical features; I do like fantasy inspired toys and toys with a sleek futuristic aesthetic. </p>
          <p class='contentS'>Everyone has different toy preferences, and what some people like others find unusable. 
          Although I strive to be objective in my reviews my preferences may influence my opinions of certain toys. </p>

      <details>
        <summary>What toys do you review?</summary>
        <div>
          <p class='contentS'>I primarily review Anal toys and Penis toys from my personal collection. 
          I also review Clitoral toys, Vaginal toys, and Couples toys
          with help and input from my wife. 
          I only use and review insertable toys that are made from body safe materials 
          ( e.g. Silicone, Stainless steel and Glass. ) <!-- I do use and review non-insertable toys
          made from less bodysafe materials such as TPE that do not not leech chemicals, but can become 
          contaminated if improperly cleaned -->

        <div>
          <p class='contentS'>• Currently my favorite Buttplug is the <a href='TantusJuice.html'>Tantus Juice Plug</a>, it is easy to insert and comfortably filling. <br>
          • My favorite Mastrubator is the <a href='ArcwavePow.html'>Arcwave Pow</a>, it has a great internal texture and is easy to clean. <br>
          • My Wife's favorite toy at the moment is the Le Wand petite, she reports that it produces powerful distributed vibrations and is not too heavy to hold for a long session.

        <div>
          <p class='contentS'>When I was preparing to launch this site I spent about 20 hous a week, writing code and composing reviews to produce enough content and an create an attractive website.
          Since launching the site I spend about 5 - 8 hours a week testing new toys and writing up reviews. I want to start producing content for social media accounts eventually which will increase the time I spend each week.

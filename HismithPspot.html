    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Hismith P-spot dildo is a toy designed to stimulate the prostate.
    The dildo is designed to to be used with Hismith sex machines, and connects with the quick-lock system.
    Hismith is one of the most renowned producer of sex-machines, with a large collection of toy models with different price points and features.
    Hismith machines are designed with a reciprocating arm which drives a dildo or another toy back and forth.
    I purchased this dildo to use with my new Hismith Foldable pro 2.0 which I will review at a later date.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Hismith P-spot is an average sized dildo with a slight curve,
    and a pronounced bump designed to stimulate the prostate. 
    It has a suction cup base, and a removable quick-lock connector. 
    It is designed to be used with a Hismith sex machine but it could also be used independently.
    It had a neutral non-anatomical shape designed to provide maximum pleasure. 
    It is a medium sized toy with an average diameter of 1.4 inches, and a max diameter at the bump of 1.7 inches.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'><b>First Use</b></br>After some warmup I connected the P-spot dildo to my Hismith Foldable pro inserted it anally and fired up the machine.
    Initially it felt really good, but after a few minutes of use I started to feel some friction. 
    I reapplied lube and reinserted the toy. The dildo felt great when used with an abundance of lube. 
    The soft silicone is quite comfortable and kinda conformed to my body, as it moved in and out. 
    The bump can turn when inserted; in the correct orientation the bump applied pleasant pressure to my prostate, bringing me to a satisfying orgasm.</br>
    <b>Observations after a handful of uses.</b>
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The P-spot is made out of soft silicone with a stainless steel quick-lock connector at the base.
    The silicone is squishy and soft but firm enough to hold it's shape. 
    The surface of the silicone is slightly tacky and attracts some lint. 
    Lube sticks to it reasonably well and makes it very slick.
    </br> The toy is of reasonably good quality, there are no seams or other surface marks.
    It connects easily and firmly to a Hismith machine, and has a good shape and firmness.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Silicone is quite durable and long lasting if treated well.
    My only concern is if the connection stub at the base could pull out damaging the surrounding silicone, 
    But this is highly unlikely.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The p-spot dildo costs $30 and is available from amazon or from the Hismith online store.
    I fell like it is reasonably priced for a silicone dildo of it's size, especially a specialized one for use with a machine.
    </br>The packaging is very discreet listing only the name of brand without any other text or pictures.
    It has an abstract design with an geometric arrangement of yellow triangles on a purple background. 
    Inside the box the Dildo was sealed in a plastic bag with cardboard inserts to hold it in place.
    I quite liked the design of the packaging it is stylish and fun while being quite discreet. 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>The Hismith p-spot dildo is a bit of a specialty item being designed for use with sex machine to stimulate the prostate,
    so I cannot universally recommend it. 
    It does perform well in it's niche; it has a nice shape, good pliability and feels great.
    It is also reasonably priced. Personally I think it is a great acessory for a hismith sex machine </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Hismith P-spot dildo is a toy designed to stimulate the prostate.
    The dildo is designed to to be used with Hismith sex machines, and connects with a quick-lock system.
    Hismith m
    I purchased this dildo to use with my new Hismith Foldable pro 2.0 which I will review at a later date.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The P-spot is made out of soft silicone with a stainless steel quick-lock connector at the base.
    The silicone is squishy and soft but firm enough to hold it's shape. 
    The surface of the silicone is slightly tacky and attracts some lint. 
    </br> The toy is of reasonably good quality, there are no seams or other surface marks.
    It connects easily and firmly to a Hismith machine, and has a good shape and firmness.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Silicone is quite durable and long lasting if treated well. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The p-spot dildo costs $30 and is available from amazon or from the Hismith online store.
    I fell like it is reasonably priced for a silicone dildo of it's size.

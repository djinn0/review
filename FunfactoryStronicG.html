    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--  -->
    <p class='content'>I enjoy most German designed products and their sex toys are no different. 
    <a>Fun Factory</a href='https://us.funfactory.com/pages/brand-story'> is German based luxury sex toy manufacturer that designs innovative and fun toys.
    The Fun Factory Stronic G is a thrusting vibrating dildo. It has a shaft coated in soft silicone with a rounded tip designed to stimulate the G spot. 
    The Stronic G is waterproof and rechargeable making it easy to use and to clean.  
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Fun factory Strionic G is a thrusting vibrating dildo.
    It has a handle with controls and an insertable section coated in medium soft silicone.
    The silicone coated insertable section is 5.75" in length with a max diameter of 1.65". 
    The Stronic G uses a solanoid which is a type of electric motor which moves back and forth instead of 
    rotating. The Stronic G has a prominant rounded head designed to stimulate the G spot.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>content
    has a good shape, one handed for use with a vibe. first electronic dildo, thrusting is better than vibrating. 
    sometimes she just wants to be kissed and find the good spots herself. better when i move with it

    The Stronic G is the first electronic dildo that we have purchased for our
    My wife reports that that the 
    Sometimes she prefers to control the Stronic G herself 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>Fun factory was one of the industry pioneers of using body safe silicone to make sex toys,
    and their silicone is excellent. The silicone has a matte surface which allows lube to stick without sliding off but gets very slick and smooth with lube. 
    The matte feels soft and does not collect dust or lint like other silicone surfaces can. 
    The Stronic G is a luxury toy and it's build quality reflects this. 
    It is satisfyingly heavy, and has a powerful but silent motor.
    It is rechargeable and has a good battery life. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The Stronic G like all Fun Factory toys is well made and feels quite durable. 
    We have had it for a couple of years now and it is still in great shape. 
    The Stronic G is waterproof so after use I wash it with soap and warm water and allow it to air-dry. 
    I recharge the toy so it's ready to go for next time then store it in a microfiber pouch.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Fun factory Strionic G costs $169.99, which
    is a bit expensive for a dildo even a motorized one.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>The Stronic G is too expensive for me to recommend it to everyone,
    but if you have the money and enjoy G-spot stimulation then it is great.
    It is good for solo play, it can be held in place with one hand leaving the other hand free to hold a vibrator. 
    It is also a great couples toy. My wife loves when I use it on her because it has a good rhythm, and I don't subconscious increase the speed like I sometimes do with other dildos.
    The quality is excellent, and I would happily purchase it again.</p>

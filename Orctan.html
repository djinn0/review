    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--  -->
    <p class='content'>The Orctan masturbator is a uniquely designed </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The orctan has 2 motorized soft silicone rollers in a hinged adjustable frame.
      The penis is placed between the rollers which stimulates the glans, fermium and shaft.
      The silicone rollers are removable for cleaning and care. 
      The Orctan has 9 different movement patterns and 3 programs which randomly combine movement patterns.
      The toy has 4 control buttons, 2 to switch between patterns and 2 to switch between programs. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, Wow does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Orctan masturbator is a premium quality toy. The silicone of the rollers is very smooth and soft. The toy is quite heavy, and much larger than I had anticipated.
    The plastic of the case has a subtle woven pattern reminiscent of carbon fiber. The battery life is excellent and has never run out during a session. The Orctan uses a standard usb c charger. 
    The motors are practically silent.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The silicone rollers are soft but feel quite durable. The hinge is beefy and unlikely to wear out. 
    Orctan includes instructions on how maintain battery life including fully charging the toy before first use, removing the toy from the charger when it is fully charged and periodically recharging it even if it has not been used for a period. 
    The rollers can be removed from the frame making them easy to clean. After cleaning the rollers I wipe down the frame.
    The soft silicone of the toy attracts lint so I keep it in the included storage bag. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Orctan masturbator originally cost $300(check) but has been on sale at Lovehoney for $90 for a few months.
    Although the Orctan is an excellent toy it was too expensive when originally released but $90 is a great deal for the Orctan.</p>

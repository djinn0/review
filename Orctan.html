    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--design overview -->
    <p class='content'>The Orctan masturbator is a unique toy, designed to replicate oral sex. 
    It has two soft silicone rollers controlled by precision motors.
    The rollers are held in a hinged frame which contains the batteries, controls and motors. 
    The Orctan Masturbator has a distinctive design and is definitely a toy where form follows function. 
    I love unique toys so I was pretty excited to try the Orctan when it was first released.  </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Orctan's design is a drastic departure from other masturbators which are usually tube shaped with a soft internal sleeve. 
    The Orctan has 2 motorized soft silicone rollers in a hinged adjustable frame.
    The penis is placed between the rollers which stimulates the glans, fermium and shaft. The hinged frame bends providing a tighter or looser fit.
    The silicone rollers are removable for cleaning and care. The precision motors that control the rollers are practically silent and discreet. 
    The Orctan has 9 different movement patterns and 3 programs which randomly combine movement patterns.
    The toy has 4 control buttons, two of the buttons switch between patterns and the other two buttons switch between programs. 
    The toy casing has LEDs that glow red during use. The Orctan is rechargeable, and has a long battery life. The large batteries make the toy quite heavy.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, Wow does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>When I received the Orctan I was very impressed by the quality of the packaging and toy. 
    I was also surprised about how large the toy was, the limited online marketing materials did not accurately convey size, its twice as big as I expected.
    The used the Orctan for the first time sitting on a couch while watching a show.
    I enjoyed trying the different vibration patterns and the toy felt really good, but the sensations were too subtle to get me to orgasm while distracted. 
    The second time I used the Orctan I devoted the time and attention to fully experience the toy. I lay down in my bed put on some music, generously applied lube and got to work.
    The sensations started out subtle but built as I became more sensitive and aroused. I selected one of the programs which rotates through the different vibration patterns. 
    The random mix of patterns and sensation kept me on the edge of orgasm. 
    A couple of times when I came too close I pressed both (check) buttons which paused the motors allowing me to cool down. 
    When I was eventually ready I selected the vibration pattern of long fast strokes and finally let the Orctan gave me the satisfying orgasm I had been anticipating.
    The Orctan has been added to the rotation of my favorite and most used toys, it is perfect for a long relaxed mastrubation session.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Orctan masturbator is a premium quality toy. The silicone of the rollers is very smooth and soft. The silicone retains lube and gets very slick. 
    The toy is quite heavy, and much larger than I had anticipated.
    The plastic of the case has a subtle woven pattern reminiscent of carbon fiber. The battery life is excellent and has never run out during a session.
    The Orctan uses a standard USB C charger, which is one of my favorite features because I can charge the toy with a phone charger rather then hunting through my box of cords looking for a proprietary charger. 
    The motors are practically silent and powerful. The motors have sensors which limit torque preventing injury.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The silicone rollers are soft but feel quite durable. The hinge is beefy and unlikely to wear out. 
    Orctan includes instructions on how to maintain battery life, including fully charging the toy before first use,
    removing the toy from the charger when it is fully charged, and periodically recharging it even if it has not been recently. 
    The rollers can be removed from the frame making them easy to clean in the sink. After cleaning the rollers I wipe down the frame.
    The soft silicone of the toy attracts lint so I keep it in the included storage bag. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Price & Packaging</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Orctan masturbator originally cost $219 but has been on sale at Lovehoney for $87.60 for a few months.
    Although the Orctan is an excellent toy it was too expensive when originally released. 
    $90 is a great price for the Orctan and is very reasonable for such a high quality toy. 
    The packaging is classy, it is black with red highlights with the same subtle carbon fiber pattern as the toy.
    Inside of the box is the massager, an instruction manual, a charging chord, and a storage bag.
    I love when toys include storage bags, especially because I didn't have one large enough to fit the Orctan.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>I love trying distinctive sex toys that experiment with new designs and provide unique sensations.
    The Orctan met my expectations, it worked as designed is good for edging and provides great Orgasms.
    Because of its open design it can be a bit messy. It is larger and less portable than I expected but overall i think it's a good size. 
    I think it's a great toy at it's current price of $90ish dollars, and I would not hesitate to buy it again.</p>

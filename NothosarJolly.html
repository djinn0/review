    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The holiday season always makes me feel a bit naughty,
    so I am excited share my review of the Nothosaur Jolly a festive tree shaped butt plug.
    I enjoy finding toys that are both highly functional and have a fun design.
    The Jolly has a for streaching while looking like a Christmas tree.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Nothosaur Jolly is shaped like a Christmas tree. 
    It has a tapered cone shape with decorative detailing and a small star on top.
    The Jolly is available in 3 sizes: small, medium, and large.
    I have the small, which is only small in comparison to the other Jolly sizes and is the largest toy I own.
    The small is 4.7 inches in length and 2.2 inches in diameter at the widest point,
    the medium is 5.9 inches in length and 2.5 inches in diameter, 
    and the large is 6.7 inches in length and 3.0 inches in diameter.
    Because of the Jollys gradually expanding cone shape it is a good training toy allowing for a gentle stretch.
    The narrower neck is designed to hold the jolly in place. 
    There is a slight taper between the bulb and the neck to make removal more comfortable.
    The base of the toy is star shaped continuing the festive theme and it has an integrated suction cup to hold the plug upright.</p>

    <p class='content'>content</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Jolly is made of molded platinum silicone and is available in three different firmnesses.
    I chose the medium firmness which is pliable but still firm enough to hold its shape especially during insertion.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Being made of pure silicone the Jolly is quite durable and should hold up to years or normal use.
    The star on top of the tree is the only detail that could potentially tear, but it is firmly affixed and quite sturdy.

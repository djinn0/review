    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The holiday season always makes me feel a bit naughty,
    so I am excited share my review of the Nothosaur Jolly a festive tree shaped butt plug.
    I enjoy finding toys that are both highly functional and have a fun design.
    The Jolly is a great blend of fun and functional it has a very usable shape and an amusing design.
    Founded in 2010, Nothosaur is Chinese manufacturer of silicone fantasy toys.
    Nothosaur Toys are available on Amazon, AliExpress and their official website.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Nothosaur Jolly is shaped like a Christmas tree. 
    It has a tapered cone shape with decorative detailing and a small star on top.
    The Jolly is available in 3 sizes: small, medium, and large.
    I have the small, which is only small in comparison to the other Jolly sizes and is the largest toy I own.
    The small is 4.7 inches in length and 2.2 inches in diameter at the widest point,
    the medium is 5.9 inches in length and 2.5 inches in diameter, 
    and the large is 6.7 inches in length and 3.0 inches in diameter.
    Because of the Jollys gradually expanding cone shape it is a good training toy allowing for a gentle stretch.
    The narrower neck is designed to hold the jolly in place. 
    There is a slight taper between the bulb and the neck to make removal more comfortable.
    The base of the toy is star shaped continuing the festive theme and it has an integrated suction cup which holds the plug upright.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>content</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Jolly is made of molded platinum silicone and is available in three different firmnesses.
    I chose the medium firmness which is pliable but still firm enough to hold its shape especially during insertion.
    The silicone has a x texture...
    The Jolly is excellent quality, the colors are bright and fun, the silicone is well moulded and does not have any major manufacturing marks or seems.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Being made of pure silicone the Jolly is quite durable and should hold up to years or normal use.
    The star on top of the tree is the only detail that could potentially tear, but it is firmly affixed and quite sturdy.
    The Jolly is easy to care for, after use I wash it with soap and warm water and allow it to dry. 
    After it drys I wipe it down with alcohol before putting it away with my other toys.
    does it collect lint?...
    
    
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Shipping, Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>Most orders and all custom orders ship from China and can take between a few days to a couple of weeks to arrive.
    Some of their signature colors ship from their warehouses located in Germany, Japan and the United States and usually arrive earlier then orders shipped from China.
    My order took 3 days to process before being shipped and finally arrived x days after I placed the order. 
    
    The Jolly costs $59.99 for the small, $79.99 for the medium and $89.99 for the large.
    I think the small is reasonably priced for a toy of quality and size. 
    The medium and large are a bit expensive</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Hot Octopus is a London based toy company that was founded to produce vibrators designed 
    specifically for males. Hot Octopuss has since expanded their toy offerings producing innovative and inclusive toys.
    The Pulse Duo is based on the original Penis specific design of the pulse line of toys, but includes an extra motor and remote for use with a partner.

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>Hot Octopus describes the Pulse as a guybrator a vibrator specifically designed for use with a penis.
    It has silicone wings that wrap around the shaft, holding the vibration plate to the frenulum for maximum sensation. 
    The wings a top of the vibrator are ribbed for additional stimulation.
    Hot Octopuss pulse toys use a use a Pulse Plate which is a weighted cylinder that oscillates back and forth producing rumbly high amplitude vibrations.
    The Pulse has buttons on both sides which control the vibration pattern and intensity. The vibration has 9 different intensities, and 7 vibration patterns.
    The bottom of the Pulse has a curved plastic plate with a second motor for stimulating a partner. 
    The second motor is controlled by a remote. The Pulse is waterproof for shower play and easy cleaning.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>The Hot Octopuss produces strong rumbly vibrations, like the bass notes from a subwoofer. 
    The Vibrations on sustained pattern are almost too strong and quickly bring me almost to orgasm.
    The variable vibration patterns are much better for edging than constant vibration.
    I wish the the toy had a pause button, I had to either shut of the vibrations or pull the toy away when the sensations started to become too intense.
    After pulling the vibrator away or turning it off I would need to reset everything before continuing, a pause button would have improved my experience.
    Due to the way the pulse plate is designed it cannot transmit vibrations unless it is held firmly to the penis. 
    The pulse plate also cannot move if it is pressed down too firmly.
    For maximum enjoyment I had to find a balance between gripping the Pulse Duo tight enough to provide plenty of sensation, 
    and not gripping it so tight that vibrations stop, but this is a pretty easy balance to find.
    The subtle silicone ridges feel really good when the toy is rocked slightly in time with the vibrations.
    Because the toy has an open design I found that things could get a bit messy if I am not careful.
    My partner did think that the vibrations were good enough to justify getting in a slightly ackward position so we could use the Pulse together.
    After experimenting with the pulse duo a couple of times, she decided that she perfered to just lay in bed next too me and use her wand while I used the pulse.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Hot Octopus pulse Duo has two ribbed silicone wings 
    which connect to the hard plastic body of the toy. The inner surface around the pulse plate is also silicone.
    The body of the toy is strong ABS plastic which houses the batery, motors and microcontroller.
    The Pulse Duo uses premium materials and appears to be well made. The main motor is rumbly and powerful.
    The buttons have a nice tactical feel and the magnetic charging chord is one of the better ones I have seen. 
    The crown logo imprinted in the silicone pulse plate is a cool detail, and gives the toy an air of sophistication 
    The quality of the vibrator is what I would expect for a toy in its price range, from a reputable manufacturer like Hot Octopuss.

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The Hot Octopus feels robust.
    The silicone is firm but flexible and there are no small details or corners where it is likely to tear.
    All of the electronics are housed in a strong plastic shell. 
    Overall the pulse duo feels like it was designed with durability in mind.
    It is rather heavy for it's size, but that is a small sacrifice for having a toy does not break easily.
    The Pulse Duo is easy to care for, I wipe of any lube or residue after use then recharge it before storing it in the included bag.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'> The Pulse Duo was packaged in a blue and black box with white detailing and text. 
    The packaging is stylish, but the cardboard is thinner and the packaging feels cheaper than other toys I have tried in a similar price range.
    In the box was the vibrator, a charging chord, remote control, storage bag, and instruction manual.
    The Pulse Duo retails for $149.95 on the Hot Octopus website, which is comparably priced to similar toys like the Fun Factory Manta. 
    I like how the Pulse Duo feels, but I do not think that the couples features add much. 
    For Me, it would have been better to get the Pulse Solo instead of the Duo and save a bit of money.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>I think the Hot Octopuss pulse toys are great, and I am happy to see companies experimenting with new and innovative toy designs.
    I am impressed with the powerful rumbly vibrations the Hot Octopuss produces and how quickly it can get me to orgasm with minimal effort.
    I think a pause button would improve the overall experience, and I hope to see one in future iterations. 
    I think the material choices and build quality of the Pulse are quite good.
    I generally really like couples toys, but I think the design of the Pulse Duo leaves a lot to be desired.

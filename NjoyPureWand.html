    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>I was intrigued by the idea of a toy that me and my wife could both share. 
    
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Njoy Pure wand is an 8 inch arc of stainless steel with bulbous rounded ends.
    The wand feels quite substantial weighing 1.5 LBS. The balls and the ends are different sizes, 
    the smaller ball is a managable 1 inch in diameter and the larger ball is 1.5 inches in diameter. 
    The smaller end is comfortable and easy to insert, the other end is quite large but provides intense sensation. 
    The wand has a gentle curve making it easy to grip and angle toward the g-spot or prostate for targeted stimulation. 
    The stainless steel is cold to the touch but conducts heat well making it great for temperature play. 
    The Pure wands is the most beautiful toy in my collection its curves are elegant and modern and its surface is polished and reflective. </p>

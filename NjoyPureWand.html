    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>I was intrigued by the idea of a finding a toy that me and my wife could both share. 
    I wanted a toy that is easy to clean and sterilize, and that would provide pleasurable stimulation for both of us despite our different anatomies.
    The Pure wand was originally designed as a prostate massager, but works equally well as a precision G spot massager.

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Njoy Pure wand is an 8 inch arc of stainless steel with bulbous rounded ends.
    The wand feels quite substantial weighing 1.5 LBS. The balls on the ends are different sizes, 
    the smaller ball is a manageable 1 inch in diameter and the larger ball is 1.5 inches in diameter. 
    The smaller end is comfortable and easy to insert, the other end is quite large but provides intense sensation. 
    The wand has a gentle curve making it easy to grip and angle toward the g-spot or prostate for targeted stimulation. 
    The stainless steel is cold to the touch but conducts heat well making it great for temperature play. It can be warmed or cooled by running under water for a minute.
    The Pure wands is the most beautiful toy in my collection, its curves are elegant and its surface is polished and reflective. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'> We keep our house relatively cool, so the first time I used the Pure wand it was uncomfortably cold. I pulled out the wand applied lube
    and inserted it without allowing it to warm up, and I found that the tissue in my butt is quite temperature sensative. I have learned my lesson and always heat the Wand with warm water if it feels too cold.
    The small end slips easily into my butt, the larger end takes more work to insert and usually requires me warming up with another toy.
    The smaller allows for precision stimulation, I do not use the larger end as often the sensation it provides is quite intense.
    I haven't achieved a prostate orgasm with the Pure wand, but I have gotten close, and it has given me some amazinging blended orgasms.

    <p class='content'>
    My Partner has used the Pure Wand a few times but generally prefers softer silicone dildos. She likes how smooth and slick it feels.
    She perfers the smaller end because it provides pin-point stimulation to her g-spot. She agrees that the metal can feel a bit cold if it isn't warmed up before insertion.
    The Wands curve makes is very easy and gratifying to use on her. Using the Pure Wand in conjuncting with a vibrator

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pure Wand is made with medical grade stainless steel.
    It is smooth and shiny and gets very slick with a bit of lube. Any type of lube can be used on stainless steel toys including silicone lubes.
    The Stainless steel conducts heat better than other commonly used sex toy materials. When I first but it quickly warms to body temperature and feels surprisingly hot after use.
    Stainless steel is extremely durable compared to other sex toy materials. It is easy to clean and sterilize and does not retain smells.
    The Pure wand feels like a quality toy it is heavy and has a beautiful polished surface. 
    It has a modern and stylish design, and almost feels like it could be sold in the gift shop of an art museum.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Njoy Pure Wand is exceptionally durable. The Wand looks brand new after a couple of years of use.
    The Wand will probably look like new my whole life unless I do something crazy with it like dropping it in an vat of acid. 
    The surface of the Pure Wand could be scratched but it would take something drastic like throwing it from a moving car.
    The Njoy Pure Wand is easy to care for, I wash it with soap and water to clean it after use. To sterilize the Wand it can be wiped with alcohol, boiled or even autoclaved.
    Between uses I keep the Wand in the packaging it came in, which conveniently doubles as a storage box.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pure wands packaging is remarkable. It came in a woden box the inside lined with pink satin. 
    The Pure Wand costs $120.00 and is rarely available on sale. The Njoy Pure wand is expensive,
    but it is an investment that will never break or wear out and will provide a lifetime of pleasure.
    <br>Note: There are knock-off wands that are significantly cheaper, I would not recommend purchasing one 
    because the alloy composition is unknown and could contain metals that are not body safe or even toxic.

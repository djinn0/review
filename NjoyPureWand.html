    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>I was intrigued by the idea of a finding a toy that me and my wife could both share. 
    I wanted a toy that is easy to clean and sterilize and that would provide pleasurable stimulation for both of us despite our different anatomies.
    
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Njoy Pure wand is an 8 inch arc of stainless steel with bulbous rounded ends.
    The wand feels quite substantial weighing 1.5 LBS. The balls and the ends are different sizes, 
    the smaller ball is a managable 1 inch in diameter and the larger ball is 1.5 inches in diameter. 
    The smaller end is comfortable and easy to insert, the other end is quite large but provides intense sensation. 
    The wand has a gentle curve making it easy to grip and angle toward the g-spot or prostate for targeted stimulation. 
    The stainless steel is cold to the touch but conducts heat well making it great for temperature play. 
    The Pure wands is the most beautiful toy in my collection, its curves are elegant and modern and its surface is polished and reflective. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pure Wand is made with medical grade stainless steel.
    It is smooth and shiny and gets very slick with a bit of lube. Any type of lube can be used on stainless steel toys including silicone lubes.
    Stainless steel is extremely durable compared to other sex toy materials. It is easy to clean and sterilize and does not retain smells.
    The Pure wand feels like a quality toy it is heavy and has a beautiful polished surface. The wand looks brand new after a couple of years of use,
    and will continue to look new my whole life unless I do something crazy with it like throw it from a moving car or drop it in a vat of acid.  </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Pure wands packaging is remarkable. It came in a woden box the inside lined with pink satin. 
    The Pure Wand costs $120.00 and is rarely available on sale. The Njoy Pure wand is expensive,
    but it is an investment that will never break or wear out and will provide a lifetime of pleasure.
    <br>Note: There are knock-off pure wands that are significantly cheaper, I would not recommend purchasing one 
    because the alloy composition is unknown and could contain metals that are definitely not body safe like stainless steel.

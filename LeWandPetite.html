    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Le Wand petite is my wifes favorite toy, and definitely gets used more then anything else in the toy box.
    The Le Wand Petite is a rechargable wand style vibrator and massager based on the classic Hitachi design.
    Although we owned the Le Wand Petite before I started this blog I have never gotten around to actually reviewing it. 
    This review may be a bit different from many reviews of the wand because it is from my perspective as a partner, rather then
    from the perspective of the primary user. 
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Le Wand is a wand style vibrator in a more compact size than traditional wands.
    It has a silicone coated vibrating head, flexible neck and tappered handle.
    It is approximately 10 inches in length and the head is 1.5 inchs in diameter.
    There are 3 buttons on the handle: 
    a plus button which increases vibration intensity, a minus button which decreases vibration intensity, and a wave button that changes the vibration pattern.
    There is a port to insert a charging cord at the base of the handle.
    It currently comes in 5 colors: rose gold, dark cherry, blue, violet, and navy.
    We have the rose gold color.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>The Le wand Petite is our most used toy by a large margin. 
    It is powerful, easy to use and reliably gives my wife an orgasm or two almost every time she uses it. 
    My enjoys penetration in conjunction with  external stimulation, and usually needs strong clitoris stimulation to orgasm,
    so we frequently use the Le Wand Petite during partnered sex. 
    It can be held between us in most postions where it provides her with strong and direct external stimulation and improves the experience for both of us. 
    She uses the wand on me occasionally and I have experimented with it solo, and these are my observations.
    The Vibrations are strong and rumbly.
    Although there are a few different vibration patterns we seldom use any of them.
    The silicon head and flexible neck make Le Wand very comfortable to use.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Le Wand has a plastic handle colored with a metalic paint that houses the battery, motor, and controls.
    The head of the Vibrator is coated in a firm silicone. 
    The neck of the vibrator is made of spring steel and is quite flexible.
    </br>The Le Wand Petite is of acceptably good quality.
    The manufacturing is good without any obvious defects.
    It has a bit of heft but is not difficult to hold due to its ergonomic tapered shape. 
    It has a good battery life and powerful vibrations. 
    The buttons have a nice tactile feel  held up to frequent use.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>I am impressed with the durability of the Le Wand Petite; 
    We have had the Petite for over 2 years and it has experienced frequent use (more than 1x per week) and it is still working like new.
    The only problem we have had is loosing the charging chord while traveling. 
    I could not purchase one from Le Wand or find any details about the size online. 
    eventually I purchased a cord that came with multiple differently sized tips.
    It uses a 5 volt 3.5mm barrel connector that plugs into a standard USB power brick.
    </br>The Le Wand Petite is easy to care for, after use I wash of the vibrator head. 
    The battery usually lasts a few sessions, but I have started recharging it after every use because the battery ran out a couple of times at inopportune moments.
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>One thing that Le Wand and their sister brand B-vibe do really well is packaging.
    Their packaging is usually bright and playful and the packaging of the petite is no exception.
    </br>The Le Wand Petite costs $145 and is avalible directly from Le Wand as well as other toy retailers. 
    Is the Le Wand Petite worth the cost? That depends, there are many wand vibrators in the $100 to $200 of similar quality with similar features,
    but we have thoroughly enjoyed the Petite so it has definitely been worth it for us.

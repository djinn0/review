    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Le Wand petite is my wifes favorite toy, and definitely gets used more then anything else in the toy box.
    The Le Wand Petite is a rechargable wand style vibrator and massager based on the classic Hitachi design.
    Although we owned the Le Wand Petite before I started this blog I have never gotten around to actually reviewing it. 
    This review may be a bit different from many reviews of the wand because it is from my perspective as a partner, rather then
    from the perspective of the primary user.

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Le Wand is a wand style vibrator in a more compact size.
    It has a silicone coated vibrating head, flexible neck and tappered handle.
    It is approximately 10 inches in length and the head is 1.5 inchs in diameter.
    There are 3 buttons on the handle: 
    a plus button which increases vibration intensity, a minus button which decreses vibration intensity, and a wave button that changes the vibration pattern.
    There is a port to insert a charging cord at the base of the handel.
    It currently comes in 5 colors: rose gold, dark cherry, blue, violet, and navy.
    We have the rose gold color.</p>

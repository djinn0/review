    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Le Wand petite is my wifes favorite toy, and definitely gets used more then anything else in the toy box.
    The Le Wand Petite is a rechargable wand style vibrator and massager based on the classic Hitachi design.
    Although we owned the Le Wand Petite before I started this blog I have never gotten around to actually reviewing it. 
    This review may be a bit different from many reviews of the wand because it is from my perspective as a partner, rather then
    from the perspective of the primary user. 
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Le Wand is a wand style vibrator in a more compact size.
    It has a silicone coated vibrating head, flexible neck and tappered handle.
    It is approximately 10 inches in length and the head is 1.5 inchs in diameter.
    There are 3 buttons on the handle: 
    a plus button which increases vibration intensity, a minus button which decreses vibration intensity, and a wave button that changes the vibration pattern.
    There is a port to insert a charging cord at the base of the handel.
    It currently comes in 5 colors: rose gold, dark cherry, blue, violet, and navy.
    We have the rose gold color.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Le Wand has a plastic handle colored with a metalic paint that houses the battery, motor, and controls.
    The head of the Vibrator is coated in a firm silicone. 
    The neck of the vibrator is likely made of spring steel because of its flexibility.

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>I am impressed with the durability of the Le Wand Petite; We have had the Petite for over 2 years and it has experienced pretty use and it is still working like new
    The only problem we have had is loosing the charging chord while traveling. 
    I could not purchase one from Le Wand or find any details about the size online. 
    eventually I purchased a cord that came with multiple differently sized tips.

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>One thing that Le Wand and their sister brand B-vibe do really well is packaging.
    Their packaging is usually bright and playful and the packaging of the petite is no exception.
    </br>The Le Wand Petite costs $145 and is avalible directly from Le Wand as well as other toy retailers. 
    Is the Le Wand Petite worth the cost? That depends, there are many wand vibrators in the $100 to $200 of similar quality with similar features,
    but we have thoroughly enjoyed the Petite so it has definitely been worth it for us.

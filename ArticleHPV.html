    <h1 class='title'>Sex Toys and HPV: safety tips and risks?</h1>

    <h2 class='content'>What is HPV?</h2>
    <p class='content'>Human Papillomavirus or HPV for short are a family of several hundred related viruses. Most HPV strains are either asymptomatic or cause mild symptoms and are naturally cleared by the body within 1 to 2 years.
    Some strains of HPV cause more serious symptoms like genital warts and cancer. 
    HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection and approximately 80% of the population will contract it sometime during their lives. 
    HPV is usually transmitted during vaginal, oral or anal sex or through close skin-to-skin contact during sex. Some HPV subtypes can be transmitted on surfaces, 
    but this occurs far less frequently then sexual transmission. Symptoms of HPV such as warts can be treated, but there is currently no treatment for the virus itself.
    There is a vaccine that protects against the most dangerous HPV subtypes.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>How does HPV cause cancer?</h2>
    <p class='content'>HPV infects the cells in the lowest layer of skin. As these cells replicate to produce new skin cells the virus is copied as well.
    The virus modifies its host cells so that it can continue to replicate within them. These modifications cause the infected cells to continue grow and separate which can create lumps of skin cells called warts.
    These modifications can also change the cells DNA inducing cancer. Two subtypes of HPV, strains 16 and 18, are particularly adept at inducing cancer and cause over 75% of HPV derived cancers.   </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Potential for HPV transmission on sex toys.</h2>
    <p class='content'>HPV is a very durable virus. It is a nonenveloped virus which means that it is not deactivated by drying out and can remain infectious on the surface. Researchers found traces of HPV on medical equipment after it had been cleaned with hospital grade disinfectant.
    In another study HPV was detected on a vibrator 24 hours after use, which shows that HPV could potentally be transmitted on sex toys. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>Unfortunately, I do not have the resources to test methods for disinfecting HPV contaminated sex toys or to demonstrate that sex toys can transmit HPV. 
    I would enjoy studing HPV transmission and deactivation, but the lab where I currently work is focused on cancer therapies rather than virology.  The studies done on disinfecting HPV contaminated 
    medical supplies are applicable to sex toys. The best practices recomended for reducing HPV transmission durring partnered sex can also be applied to sex toy use.    
    I have provided a few ideas to minimize risk of HPV transmission based on current studies and best practice. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>How to minimize risk of </h2>
     <ul class='content'>
      <li><b>Do not share toys</b>
        <ul>
          <li>This is the simplest method of avoiding HPV infection. A toy can not transmit HPV to another person if it is not shared.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Get Vaccinated</b>
      	<ul>
          <li>A safe and effective vaccine has been developed against the most dangerous subtypes of HPV. The CDC recomends vaccination for everyone age 12-26. 
          The CDC also recommends adults older than 26 who have a higher risk of HPV infection get vaccinated. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>Use a condom or other barrier </b>
      	<ul>
          <li>HPV is transmited through skin-to-skin or surface-to-skin contact. A Condom can act as a barrier preventing virus transferience from a contaminated surface.
          Condoms are more effective at preventing HPV infection on sex toys than in partnered sex because they can completely cover the toy providing an effective barrier.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>Thoroughly clean sex toys</b>
      	<ul>
          <li>Soap and water do not deactivate HPV but they can wash it off a surface. Sex toys should be washed after use to remove microbes and keep them clean and sanitary.
          Scrubbing a sex toy with soap and water can remove HPV from a surface reducing the risk of transmission.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li><b>UV Sterilization </b>
      	<ul>
          <li>UV sterilization has been shown to be effective at deactivating HPV and decontaminating surfaces. 
          After discovering that standard cleaning procedures were ineffective at deactivating HPV most Obstetrician and Gynecologist offices switched to using UV
          to sterilize their tools. Bvibe sells a <a href='https://www.bvibe.com/uv-sterilizer-pouch.html'>UV sterilizer</a> designed specifically for sex toys.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Risk of contracting HPV through Sex toy use is pretty low, but I think it is valuable to be educated about any potential risks. 
    As a Sex toy enthusiasist and a Microbiology nerd HPV contamination of sex toys is a topic that I wanted to research and write about.

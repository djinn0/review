    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>

    <h2 class='content'>What is a Queening Chair?</h2>
    <p class='content'>A Queening chair is a low stool or chair with an open center allowing easy access to the genitals. 
    The giving partner lays on their back with their face through the chairs opening, while the receiving partner sits on the chair over their partners face.
    A queening stool allows the pelvic floor muscles and major croch muscles to relax allowing access to
    the vagina and anus and potentially exposing the labia minora. A Queening Chair can makes facesitting more comfortable for both participants;
    instead of straining their leg muscles squatting the receiving partner can relax, and the giving partner can move and breath easier without getting crushed by their partners body weight
    By increasing comfort Queening chairs allow partners to take longer, potentially increasing pleasure
    </p>
    
    <p class='content'>Queening Chairs come in various styles from simple unornamented stools to elaborate thrones with armrests and luxurious cushioning. 
    A smotherbox is a style of Queening chair designed to lock the giving partners head in place. Smotherboxes can have locks or connection points for arm restraints.
    Smotherboxes ussualy have lots of padding to support the head and neck of giving partner and to block sound.</p>

    <p class='content'>Queening chairs are growing in popularity but are still a niche item, and are expensive or difficult to find or both. 
    I decided that if I wanted a Queening Chair that I would have to build it my self. I have written up my experience building a Queening Chair to 
    inspire others who are considering building a chair and looking for ideas.</p>
    
      
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design Considerations</h2>
    <p class='content'>I wanted to build a chair that is sturdy, easy to build, and relatively inexpensive to construct.
    To make the chair sturdy I planned to use a solid wood board with the hole cut in the center rather then the side like some designs.
    Putting the hole in the middle gave me 2 supports rather then one, but it did require me to drill a hole for the saw blade and made cutting more difficult.
    To make the chair easy to build I used wood that could be worked with common powertools and preconstructed legs that I ordered online.
    To keep the chair inexpensive I used a simple design and built it my self. </p>

    <p class='content'>I cut my wood board to the right size, I chose an 11" by 11" square. Next printed an ellipsis and traced it onto the boards surface</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--design overview -->
    <p class='content'>I have have had the Njoy Pure Wand for over a year and have wanted the Pure Plug ever since I got the Wand.
    The plug comes in 3 sizes, small, medium, and large.
    I waited to buy a Pure Plug because I was not sure if I should get the size Medium or Large.
    When I found the large on sale I decided to go for it, and I have been quite satisfied with my purchase.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p>The Njoy Pure Plug is a stainless steel butt plug. It has an elegant rounded shape with a large tapered bulb, curved neck and loop base. 
    It has an organic futuristic look, which is enhanced by its mirror finish. The large Plug has a diameter of 1.5 inches and an insertable length of 2.75 inches
    Njoy toys are quite weighty because they are made of stainless steel, the Pure Plug Large weighs a substantial 1.16 lbs.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, Wow does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>Toys between 1.4 inches and 2 inches in diameter are a strech for me but still usable,
    so I knew that I would need to warm up before inserting the Large Pure Plug. 
    I started out with a relatively small plug, after 10 min I got impatient and decided just to go for it. 
    
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Pure plug is made with 316 grade stainless steel, 
    which is an alloy of iron, nickel chromium and molybdenum. 
    316 stainless steel is corrosion resistant and nonreactive;
    it is used to make surgical tools and pharmacitical devices and is an excellent material for sex toys.
    The Pure Plug is very smooth and feels cold to the touch but warms to body temperature during use. 
    
  
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Stainless Steel is exceptionally durable. 
    The Pure Plug should withstand a lifetime of normal use without showing any signs of damage or wear. 
    The plug is very easy to clean with soap and warm water. 
    It can also be sterilize in boiling water or with alcohol. 
    The shiny surface of the plug can show fingerprints but these can be wiped off with a microfiber cloth.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Price & Packaging</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Njoy Pure Plug Large costs $85.00, which is on the expensive side for a Plug,
    but it is great quality and long lasting. 
    For me the Pure plug is worth the price and I would purchase it again.

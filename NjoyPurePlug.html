    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--design overview -->
    <p class='content'>I have had the Njoy Pure Wand for over a year and have wanted the Pure Plug ever since I got the Wand.
    The Pure Plug is a butt plug made from stainless steel with a unique curved shape.
    The plug comes in 3 sizes, small, medium, and large.
    I waited almost a year to buy a Pure Plug because I was not sure what size to get.
    I wanted a filling plug that was not overly difficult to insert, I was trying to decide wether to get the medium or large.
    When I found the large on sale I decided to go for it, and I have been quite satisfied with my purchase.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Njoy Pure Plug is a stainless steel butt plug. It has an elegant rounded shape with a large tapered bulb, curved neck and loop base. 
    It has an organic futuristic look, which is enhanced by its mirror finish. The large Plug has a diameter of 1.5 inches and an insertable length of 2.75 inches
    Njoy toys are quite weighty because they are made of stainless steel, the Pure Plug Large weighs a substantial 1.16 lbs.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>Toys between 1.4 inches and 2 inches in diameter are a strech for me but still usable,
    so I knew that I would need to warm up before inserting the large Pure Plug. 
    I started warming up with a relatively small plug, after 10 min I got impatient and decided just to go for it. 
    I applied lube generously to the Pure Plug and slowly inserted it using consistant but gentle pressure.
    To get a good angle for the toys curve and open myself up, I lay on the ground with my butt lifted and my feet on the couch.
    As the Pure Plug slowly slid into me, it put a lot of pressure on my prostate.
    When the plug was in place, I rhythmically rock the plug back and forth, occasionally touching myself. 
    The sensations built until I orgasmed, which to my amazement did not produce ejaculate.
    I have only had a prostate orgasm a handful of times so I was pleasantly surprised by the experience.
    The Pure Plug is comfortable while standing or walking, but the base digs in while sitting.
    the plug feels very secure, even though it is heavy it does not feel like it will slip out.
    The plug is relatively easy to pull out after use despite its size.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Pure plug is made with 316 grade stainless steel, 
    which is an alloy of iron, nickel chromium and molybdenum. 
    316 stainless steel is corrosion resistant and nonreactive;
    it is used to make surgical tools and pharmacitical devices and is an excellent material for sex toys.
    The Pure Plug is very smooth and feels cold to the touch but warms to body temperature during use. 
    The Njoy Pure Plug feels like a premium toy with a lot of thought put into the shape.
    It is shiny an sleak and reminiscent of an abstract sculpture.

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Stainless Steel is exceptionally durable. 
    The Pure Plug should withstand a lifetime of normal use without showing any signs of damage or wear. 
    The plug is very easy to clean with soap and warm water. 
    It can also be sterilize in boiling water or with alcohol. 
    The shiny surface of the plug can show fingerprints, but these can be wiped off with a microfiber cloth.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Price & Packaging</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Njoy Pure Plug Large costs $85.00, which is on the expensive side for a Plug,
    but it is great quality and long lasting. 
    For me the Pure plug is worth the price and I would purchase it again. 
    Like other Njoy toys the Pure Plug came in a black display box lined with bright pink satin. 
    The storage box came wrapped in a white cardbord sleeve with a minimalist aesthetic.
    I like understated design and I feel like the packaging really helps sell the Njoy Pure Plug as a classy and premium toy.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>The Njoy Pure plug lives up to its stellar reputation;
    it is one of the best butt plugs I have ever used. 
    It is very filling due to its shape and weight, but is not too difficult to get in.
    I am glad that I finally bought it and look forward to years of use.</p>

    <p class='content'>Hi I'm Dave, the captain of this review blog. I am a microbiologist by trade and a sex toy enthusiast by nature. I enjoy cooking, reading, outdoor adventures,and skiing. I absolutly despise waiting in lines </p>
    <p class='content'>I started this blog as a personal project to teach myself web development. I was inspired to write about and review sex toys by other blogs that I have enjoyed reading.</p>
    <p class='content'>Two distinguishing characteristics of mine are: that I have ADHD, and I am happily married. Neither characteristic is particulary unique but the interplay between the two is at times intresting. 
      Although multiple studies have been conducted on the impact of ADHD on sexuality, most of these studies are focused general trends rather than personal experiences.  
      My ADHD manifests in increased sexuality, and a desire to try new things. I channel this desire for novelty into trying new and interesting sex toys. </p>
    <p class='content'>I enjoy researching, purchasing and trying new sex toys. I also enjoy discussing things I like; When I read an intresting book or watch a good movie I can hardly wait to discuss it with my friends.  
      I would love to share my experiences and observations about sex toys in the same casual way I discuss board games, books or movies, but discussing sex toys can be some what taboo.
      Writing a blog allows me to share my observations and hopefully provide a unique prospective on toys I have tried, in a forum better suited to sex toys</p

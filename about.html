    <p class='content'>Hi I'm Dave, I am a microbiologist by trade and a sex toy enthusiast by nature. I enjoy cooking and skiing and absolutly despise waiting in lines </p>
    <p class='content'>I am ADHD and I am happily married; neither condition is particulary unique but the interplay between the two is intresting. 
      Although multiple studies have been conducted on the impact of ADHD on sexuality, most of these studies are focused general trends rather than personal experiences.  
      My ADHD manifests in increased sexuality, and a desire to try new things. I channel this desire for novelty into trying new and interesting sex toys. </p>
    <p class='content'>I enjoy researching, purchasing and trying new sex toys, I also enjoy talking about things I like. When I read an intresting book or watch a good movie I can hardly wait to discuss it.  
      I would love to share my experiences and observations about sex toys in the same way I discuss board games, books or movies with my friends, but discussing sex toys requires a different different forum 
      than a casual conversation. Writing a blog allows me to share my observations and hopefully provide a unique prospective on toys I have tried</p

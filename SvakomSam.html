    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Svakom is an international designer and manufacturer of sex toys.
    Founded in 2012 in the United States the majority of their business operations have moved to Shenzhen China.
    Svakom made one of the first sex toys I ever purchased, a vibrating ring and are therefore partially responsible for my toy obsession.
    Svakom have greatly expanded their toy catalog with a recent been focus on producing more premium toys.
    The Sam is one of their newest offerings, it is an an app controlled penetratable toy that uses suction and vibrations.

    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Svakom Alex Neo 2 Pro is an automated male masturbator that stimulates through suction and vibrations.
    The Alex is a plastic cylinder with a power button at the base and an opening to a soft sleeve in the top.
    The cap of the Alex has a warming element which is the only difference between the pro model and the regular version which does not have a heater.
    The top portion of the case is hollow and holds the sleeve. 
    The bottom third of the cylinder houses the motor, controls and battery. 
    On the side of the toy is a USB C port for charging. I like that the Alex Uses a standard charger format like USB C rather than a proprietary connector.
    The power button has battery charge indicator lights which is also a nice feature. 
    There is an air-pump below the sleeve which produces suction, and a vibrating motor that sits next to the sleeve.
    The Sleeve is removable for cleaning.
    The Alex connects seamlessly to a phone app via Bluetooth. 
    The toy can sync with music and other media.
    There are multiple stimulating patterns and the vibrations and suction can be controlled independently. 
    The Sam can also be controlled at a distance via the phone app making it an ideal toy for travel and distance play.

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>The Pro version of the Sam Neo features a cap with a heating element which warms the toy to body temperature before use.
    This is the first warming toy I have tested, so I did not anticipate enjoying the warming feature as much as I did.
    The suction feature is very stimulating and rapidly brought my close to orgasm the first time I tried the Sam;
    adding in vibrations quickly pushed me over the edge.
    The suction and vibrations are pleasantly strong but not overwhelming.
    The vibration and suction can be controlled independently in the app which gave me unparalleled control over the sensations I was feeling.
    I also liked syncing the Svakom Sam to music and enjoying it hands free.
    The Sam is the best electronic masturbator I have tried so far.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Svakom Sam has a hard ABS plastic shell that houses a soft TPE sleeve.
    ABS is a strong plastic that used to manufacturer a variety of items like legos, kitchen utensils and of course sex toys. 
    TPE or Thermoplastic Elastomer is a soft rubbery plastic. 
    TPE is frequently used in toy sleeves but it is porous so it cannot be fully disinfected and it is less durable than silicone.
    </br>Recently Svakom has been trying to increase their share of the premium adult toy market, and the Sam reflects this.
    The Sam is of acceptably good quality, with premium features like a heater and app connectivity.
    The app is excellent, and is the best I have used so far. The suction and vibrations feel exquisite, which is what I expect from a premium toy.

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The electronics are all incased in plastic and are therefore protected from damage.
    TPE is relatively sturdy but will eventually tear or degrade with use. 
    My sleeve has some minor tears on the outside from reinserting it into the case, but they do not effect functionality.
    The sleeve can be a bit tricky to rinse out after use because it has a closed ended. 
    The sleeve also takes a long time to dry.
    I tried a few methods to improve drying like shaking it out and placing it upside down.
    I found the best method of drying the sleeve is to allow the outside of the sleeve to dry then
    place it back in the case infront of a fan to help dry the interior. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The packaging of the Svakom Sam Neo 2 is understated but classy, 
    it is white with black text and silver highlights. 
    The packaging has a world map highlighting the Sam's distance play features. 
    Inside the box the Sam is held in place by a foam cocoon.
    The excellent packaging elevates the unboxing experience and definitely makes it feel like a premium toy.
    Svakom has reduced the price of the Sam Neo 2 from $179.00 to $139.00. 
    It is in the middle of the price range for toys with similar features. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>Svakom is an internal designer and manufacturer of sex toys.
    Founded in 2012 in the United States most of their business operations have moved to Shenzhen China.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Svakom Alex Neo 2 Pro is an automated male masturbator that stimulates through suction and vibrations.
    The Sam is a plastic cylinder with a powerbutton at the base and an opening to a soft sleeve at the other end.
    The cap of the Sam has a warming element which is the difference between the pro model and the regular version which does not have a heater.
    The bottom third of the cylinder houses the motor, controls and battery. 
    On the side of the toy is a USB C port for charging. I like that the Sam Uses a standard charger format like USB C rather than a proprietary connector.
    The power button has battery charge indicator lights.
    There is an airpump below the sleeve which produces suction, and a vibrating motor that sits next to the sleeve.
    The Sleeve is removable for cleaning.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Svakom Sam has a hard ABS plastic shell that houses a soft TPE sleeve.
    ABS is a strong plastic and is frequently used for sex toys. TPE or Thermoplastic Elastomer 
    
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>The electronics are all incased in plastic 
      The sleeve can be a bit tricky to rinse out after use because it is closed ended. 
    The sleeve also takes a long time to dry.
    I tried a few methods of improving drying like shaking is out or placing it upside down.
    I found the best method of drying the sleeve is to allow the outside of the sleeve to dry then
    place it back in the case infront of a fan. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>Svakom has $179.00 to $139.00</p>

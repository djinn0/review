    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Sapphire is a fantasy inspired stroker made by Weredog Creations,
    a UK based indie toy manufacturer.

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Sapphire is made of premium hand poured silicone. 
    Weredog uses a super soft silicone blend for all penetratables.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Premium platinum cured silicone is pretty</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Weredog Sapphire was packaged in a opaque polyurethane heat sealed bag with Weredog branding.
    The packaging was similar to other small manufacturers that I have purchased from in the past. 
    I like simple bag for packaging because it keeps the toy clean in transit, produces minimal waste, and is easy to dispose of discreetly.
    Weredog included a branded storage sack to store the toy which is a nice touch. The Sapphire is priced based on selected colors with a base price of $115.84.
    I got the signature style which fades from light blue to dark blue with white accents which costs $142.16.

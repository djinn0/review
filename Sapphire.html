    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--Short intro, company background, toy design, why you excited to try it.-->
    <p class='content'>The Sapphire is a fantasy inspired stroker made by Weredog Creations,
    a UK based indie toy manufacturer. 
    Weredog was founded to produce fantasy adult products for the european market but have expanded and ship toys all over the world.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Sapphire is a dragon inspired stroker.
    It is an open ended design, made with soft platinum-cured silicone.
    The Sapphire has dragon scale and spine detailing on the outside.
    It has a small entrance, a wider rippled chamber which narrows into the main channel.
    It comes in 2 sizes narrow and wide, this review is for the wide. 
    I usually do not like anatomical styled toys, they look like severed appendages which I find off-putting,
    so I usually choose toys with abstract functional designs.
    The Sapphire is the first fantasy toy I have tried and for me the styling improved the experience,
    so I will likely test more fantasy toys in the future.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->
    <p class='content'>I knew that the Sapphire would be tight, so I applied Lube generously to the toy and to myself.
    squeeze came very, fast... ridge on underside of glans.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Sapphire is made of premium platinum-cured silicone. 
    Weredog uses a super soft silicone blend for all penetratables. 
    The silicone has a smooth somewhat sticky surface, it gets very slick when wet and unfortunately attracts lint when dry.
    The Sapphire is great quality, The exterrier detailing is intricate and the coloring is vibrant and precise.  </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Weredog states the  following about the durability of their silicon:
    "Its's strong and flexible, so it will take the roughage of average use without any worry of splits or tears.
    With that said, it will cut if you take a sharp implement to it!" 
    In my experience the Sapphire appears to be well made, there are no thin ridges or delicate details that can be torn off 
    <!--After three uses I noticed a small tear
    I have only had it for a few weeks, but I expect to last for a few years like other premium silicone toys I have tried.
    Silicone is nonporus and cannot be colonized by bacteria but it should be washed and cleaned after every use to keep it hygenic.
    I wash out the Sapphire after use and allow it to air dry. Once dry I store it in the included storage sack between uses.
    Occasionally I sterilize the Sapphire along with my other silicone toys.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Weredog Sapphire was packaged in a opaque polyurethane heat sealed bag with Weredog branding.
    The packaging was similar to other small manufacturers that I have purchased from in the past. 
    I like when a simple bag is used as packaging because it keeps the toy clean in transit, produces minimal waste, and is easy to dispose of discreetly.
    Weredog included a branded storage sack to store the toy which is a nice touch. The Sapphire is priced based on the selected color with a base price of $115.84.
    I got the signature style which fades from light blue to dark blue with white accents and costs $142.16. The Sapphire is similarly priced to other premium silicone fantasy toys.
    It's somewhat expensive, but it is a reasonable investment in pleasure.

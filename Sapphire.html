    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Sapphire is made of premium hand poured silicone. 
    Weredog uses a super soft silicone blend for all penetratables. The Sapphire is excellent quality 
    The detailing is intricate and the coloring is vibrant and precise. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>Weredog states that their silicon
    "Its's strong and flexible, so it will take the roughage of average use without any worry if splits or tears.
    With that said it will cut  if you take a sharp implement to it</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Weredog Sapphire was packaged in a opaque polyurethane heat sealed bag with Weredog branding.
    The packaging was similar to other small manufacturers that I have purchased from in the past. 
    I like simple bag for packaging because it keeps the toy clean in transit, produces minimal waste, and is easy to dispose of discreetly.
    Weredog included a branded storage sack to store the toy which is a nice touch. The Sapphire is priced based on selected colors with a base price of $115.84.
    I got the signature style which fades from light blue to dark blue with white accents which costs $142.16. The Sapphire is similarly priced to other premium silicone fantasy toys;
    It's somewhat expensive, but it is a reasonable investment in pleasure.

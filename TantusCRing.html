    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <!--  -->
    <p class='content'>Cock Rings are designed to produce stronger or longer erections by restricting blood flow from the penis. 
    I have a few cock rings, but I use them because I feel like the inconvenience and discomfort of putting one on outweighs the sensation they provide.
    Tantus, like most toy manufacturers, produces cock rings, I have liked their silicone and have enjoyed their buttplug designs so I decided to give one of their rings a try. </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus C Ring has a very simple design, it is a uniform circle of stretchy silicone. Unstreched the ring is 1.5 inches in diameter 
    I personally prefer simpler cock rings because they are easier to get on and off and I do not feel like overly complicated designs at much to the experience.
    The band of the ring is relatively wide and the edges are rounded preventing it from digging into the skin during use.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <!-- First impressions, how does it feel. what works and what doesn't.  -->

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <!-- What is it made of? How does it feel. -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus Soft Cock Ring is made of soft strechy silicone with a matte finish.
    It comes in 3 colors: crimson, lilac, onyx.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Durability & Care</h2>
    <!-- How does it hold up to use.   -->
    <p class='content'>I have used the Tantus Soft Cock ring a few times with no signs of wear or tearing.
    Silicone rubber is durable and relatively fatigue resistant so it should last a while as long as it is not overstretched.
    After use I clean the ring with soap and warm water.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Ring was packaged in clear plastic clamshell packaging with a colored cardboard insert. 
    The packaging was easy to open without scissors, and nicely displayed the toy inside.
    The Tantus Soft Cock ring costs $12.00 which is a reasonable price for a toy of its quality.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>The design and quality of Tantus Soft Cock ring are good but it may be too tight for some users.
    Tantus makes larger rings 1.75 an 2 inches in diameter but they are more difficult to find and more significantly more expensive despite using only a bit more material.

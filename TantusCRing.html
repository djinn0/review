    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <!--How does it look and feel. what style of toy is it. Unique features. -->
    <p class='content'>The Tantus C Ring has a very simple design, it is a uniform circle of stretchy silicone.
    I personally prefer simpler cock rings because they are easier to get on and off and I do not feel like overly complicated designs at much to the experience.
    The band of the ring is realitivy wide and the edges are rounded preventing it from digging into the skin during use.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <!-- How much does it cost? Is it worth the price? -->
    <p class='content'>The Ring was packaged in clear plastic clamshell packaging with a colored cardboard insert. 
    The packaging was easy to open without scissors, and nicely displayed the toy inside.
    The Tantus Soft Cock ring costs $12.00 which is a reasonable price for a toy of its quality.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <!-- Do you recommend it, why? summery of experience. -->
    <p class='content'>The design and quality of Tantus Soft Cock ring are good but it may be too tight for some users.
    Tantus makes larger rings 1.75 an 2 inches in diameter but they are more difficult to find and more significantly more expensive despite using only moderately more material.

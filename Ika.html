    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>Long sensuous tentacles are a staple of fantasy toys and henti.
    As a nautical themed blog I decided to was high time I acquired tentacle inspired toy to review.
    I chose the Ika, a tentacle toy produced by Bad Dragon, one of the oldest and most well known adult fantasy toy manufacturers.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bad Dragon Ika is a fantasy dildo styled like a tentacle. It comes in 5 sizes mini to extra large.
    This review is for the mini, which is 6.5 inches in total length with an insertable length of 5.25 inches, and a max diameter of 1.8 inches.
    The Ika tappers from a narrow point into a thick body and has a slight s-curve.
    The back of the Ika is smooth while the front is textured is textured with hundreds of rounded suckers.
    The toy has a large rounded base that is wider than any other part of the tentacle. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Ika is made of premium platinum-cured silicone</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>Like other Bad Dragon toys the Ika was packaged in a opaque polyethylene plastic bag with the Bad Dragon logo and branding.
    The packaging is similar to many other small toy manufactures. A bag is a good choice for packaging because it keeps the toy clean in transit, is easy to discreetly, and produces minimal waste.
    The price of the Ika varries by size, from the mini that starts at $65 up to the extra large which costs $200. There is also an additional charge for custom colors.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>Long sensuous tentacles are a staple of fantasy toys and Henti.
    As a nautical themed blog I decided to was high time I acquired tentacle inspired toy to review.
    I chose the Ika, a tentacle toy produced by Bad Dragon, one of the oldest and most well known adult fantasy toy manufacturers.</p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bad Dragon Ika is a fantasy dildo styled like a tentacle. It comes in 5 sizes mini to extra large.
    This review is for the mini, which is 6.5 inches in total length with an insertable length of 5.25 inches, and a max diameter of 1.8 inches.
    The Ika tappers from a narrow point into a thick body and has a slight s-curve.
    The back of the Ika is smooth while the front is textured with lots of circular suckers.
    The toy has a large rounded base that is wider than any other part of the tentacle, making it safe for both anal and vaginal use.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>I tested the Ika anally and my wife tried it vaginally, the toy preformed admirably in both regards. 

    <b>Anal Exploration</b>
    The Ika requires a lot of lube for Anal play. Lube especially thinner water based varieties slide off the slick surface of the Ika, but the suckers catch and hold lube. 
    Because the toy has a thin narrow tip it does not require any warm-up to insert. As my body relaxed I was able to insert the tentacle deeper. 
    The texture of the suckers feels nice and is more noticable then expected</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Ika is made of premium platinum-cured silicone. 
    Platinum is used as a catalyst which polymerizes the silicone components into a uniform solid without any residue or toxic byproduct. 
    The toy can be ordered in 3 different silicone firmnesses, soft, medium or hard. I ordered the Ika in soft silicon for comfort, for a larger toy I would probably choose a firmer silicone so it holds it shape.
    The Ika is my first toy from Bad Dragon and I was impressed by the quality. It is free surface defects or trimming marks. 
    </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>Like other Bad Dragon toys the Ika was packaged in a opaque polyethylene plastic bag with the Bad Dragon logo and branding.
    The packaging is similar to many other small toy manufactures. A bag is a good choice for packaging because it keeps the toy clean in transit, is easy to discreetly, and produces minimal waste.
    The price of the Ika varries by size, from the mini that costs $65 up to the extra large which costs $200. There is also an additional charge for custom colors.
    Bad Dragon toys are a bit expensive but they are great quality, highly customizable and fulfill a specific niche. I think the Ika is worth the cost if you are specifically looking for a tentacle styled toy.

    <h2 class='content'>Introduction</h2>
    <p class='content'>Long sensuous tentacles are a staple of fantasy toys and Henti.
    As a nautical themed blog I decided to was high time I acquired tentacle inspired toy to review.
    I chose the Ika, a tentacle toy produced by Bad Dragon, one of the oldest and most well known adult fantasy toy manufacturers.
    Bad dragon has been designing and producing premium silicone fantasy sex toys since 2008.
    They are a fixture in the Adult toy industry and have helped popularize fantasy toys. </p>
    
    <h2 class='content'>Design</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Bad Dragon Ika is a fantasy dildo styled like a tentacle. It comes in 5 sizes mini to extra large.
    This review is for the mini, which is 6.5 inches in total length with an insertable length of 5.25 inches, and a max diameter of 1.8 inches.
    The Ika tappers from a narrow point into a thick body and has a slight s-curve.
    The back of the Ika is smooth while the front is textured with lots of circular suckers.
    The toy has a large rounded base that is wider than any other part of the tentacle, making it safe for both anal and vaginal use.
    I personally prefer insertible toys with fanciful nonphalic shapes like unicorn horns or flowers so I Love the design of the Ika. </p>

    <h2 class='content'>Experience</h2>
    <p class='content'>I tested the Ika anally and my wife tried it vaginally, the toy preformed admirably in both regards.</p>
    <h3 class='content'>Vaginal Fun</h3>
    <p class='content'>My partner felt that the tip is too narrow and that the toy needs to be inserted quite deep for her to feel the wider body of the toy.
    She loved the texture of the suckers and reported that they were quite stimulating. 
    She also liked the softness and feel of the silicone. 
    We both enjoyed the design and colors of the toy. Her biggest complaint was that the intense texture of the toy could get a bit irritating after a long use session.
    Using the Ika on her with creamy lube was very visually stimulating and a huge turn on for me.</p>
    <h3 class='content'>Anal Exploration</h3>
    <p class='content'>The Ika requires a lot of lube for Anal play. Lube especially thinner water based varieties slide off the slick surface of the Ika, but the suckers catch and hold lube. 
    Because the toy has a thin narrow tip it does not require any warm-up to insert. As my body relaxed I was able to insert the tentacle deeper. 
    The soft silicone is squishy which makes it quite comfortable. The tapered body of the toy makes it excellent for stretching. 
    The texture of the suckers feels nice and is more noticable then expected. The base is a bit difficult to hold onto especially when slick with lube.</p>

    <h2 class='content'>Material & Quality</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Ika is made of premium platinum-cured silicone. 
    Platinum is used as a catalyst which polymerizes the silicone components into a uniform solid without any residue or toxic byproduct. 
    The toy can be ordered in 3 different silicone firmnesses, soft, medium or hard. I ordered the Ika in soft silicon for comfort, for a larger toy I would probably choose a firmer silicone so it holds it shape.
    The Ika is my first toy from Bad Dragon and I was impressed by the quality. The silicone is vibrantly colored. The details are excelent It is free from noticable seems, surface defects or trimming marks. 
    The quality of the Ika is exactly what I expected frow a renowned brand like Bad Dragon.

    <h2 class='content'>Packaging & Price</h2>
    <p class='content'>Like other Bad Dragon toys the Ika was packaged in a opaque polyethylene plastic bag with the Bad Dragon logo and branding.
    The packaging is similar to many other small toy manufactures. A bag is a good choice for packaging because it keeps the toy clean in transit, is easy to discreetly, and produces minimal waste.
    The packaging was less impressive than similar priced toys, but I honestly do not mind because it all gets thrown away anyways.
    The price of the Ika varries by size, from the mini that costs $65 up to the extra large which costs $200. There is also an additional charge for custom colors.
    Bad Dragon toys are a bit expensive but they are great quality, highly customizable and fulfill a specific niche. I think the Ika is worth the cost if you are specifically looking for a tentacle styled toy.

    <h2 class='content'>Conclusions</h2>
    <p class='content'>The Ika is a quite a versatile toy, it feels good both vaginally or anally.</p>
    The design is excellent, it definitely looks like the tentacle from a giant sea creature and my overactive imagination takes off there.
    The colors are vibrant and cool, and the detailing on the suckers looks and feels exceptional.
    Like many bad dragon toys there can be a bit of a wait if you want a custom color,
    bad dragon opens a que for custom orders at the start of each month.
    larger sizes can be quite expensive because the require a significant amount of materials to make, and Bad Dragon toys come with a premium price tag.
    The Ika definitely adds some whimsy and excitement to our toybox.</p>
